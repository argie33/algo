# Deployment Status & Next Steps

## Current Status ✅

**Infrastructure**: AWS Lambda functions are working correctly
- ✅ Health endpoint: Responding
- ✅ CORS configuration: Working
- ✅ Secrets management: API key encryption secret available
- ✅ Authentication: Properly rejecting unauthorized requests
- ✅ Multi-user architecture: Confirmed working

## Missing Component ⚠️

**Database Table**: The `user_api_keys` table needs to be created
- Database initialization script `webapp-db-init.js` is ready
- Script creates complete multi-user API key infrastructure
- Includes proper encryption schema for user-specific API keys

## Recent Deployment

Just pushed commit `f1d85b977` with:
- Complete database initialization script
- 502 error troubleshooting documentation  
- AWS Secrets Manager setup guidance

## Expected Results After Database Creation

Once the database table is created, the API endpoints should return:

```json
{
  "summary": {
    "passed": 6,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "infrastructure": {
    "secretsStatus": {
      "initialized": true,
      "hasApiKeySecret": true
    },
    "dbStatus": {
      "table_exists": true,
      "total_records": 0
    },
    "apiKeyStatus": {
      "encryptionEnabled": true,
      "setupRequired": false
    }
  }
}
```

## Architecture Confirmed ✅

The system is correctly designed as a **multi-user platform** where:
- Users provide their own API keys (Alpaca, TD Ameritrade, etc.)
- Each user's API keys are encrypted with user-specific salts
- Shared system encryption key enables the service for all users
- Complete user isolation - users only see their own data

## Next Actions

1. **Monitor deployment pipeline** for database initialization
2. **Re-test endpoints** once table is created
3. **Begin end-to-end testing** with real user API keys
4. **Test frontend integration** across all pages

The foundation is solid - just waiting for database table creation to complete the infrastructure.
