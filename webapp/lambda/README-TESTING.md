npm run test:coverage

# Custom test runner with detailed reporting
node tests/test-runner.js --help
```

## üìä Test Execution & Reporting

### World-Class Test Runner
The custom test runner (`test-runner.js`) provides:
- **Real-time Progress**: Live test execution monitoring
- **Category Organization**: Tests grouped by Infrastructure, Security, Performance, etc.
- **Priority Execution**: Critical tests run first
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed success/failure analysis
- **Quality Assessment**: Automatic quality scoring and grading
- **Recommendations**: Actionable improvement suggestions

### Quality Scoring
Tests are evaluated on four dimensions:
- **Infrastructure Health** (25 points): Database, connections, core services
- **Security & Compliance** (25 points): Authentication, encryption, audit trails
- **Business Logic** (25 points): Financial calculations, API services, workflows
- **Performance & Scale** (25 points): Load handling, response times, concurrency

Quality grades:
- **A+ (95-100)**: World-Class quality
- **A (90-94)**: Excellent quality
- **B+ (80-89)**: Good quality
- **Below 80**: Needs improvement

## üèóÔ∏è Test Architecture

### No-Mock Design Principles
1. **Real Infrastructure**: Tests connect to actual PostgreSQL databases
2. **Real Services**: AWS Secrets Manager, Cognito, external APIs
3. **Real Data**: Market data, financial calculations, user workflows
4. **Real Performance**: Actual response times, memory usage, concurrency
5. **Real Security**: Encryption, authentication, audit trails

### Test Isolation
- **Database Cleanup**: Each test cleans up its data
- **User Isolation**: Test users with unique identifiers
- **Concurrent Safety**: Tests designed for parallel execution
- **Resource Management**: Proper connection and memory cleanup

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Infrastructure Failures**: Tests continue even if some services are unavailable
- **Graceful Degradation**: Tests report warnings vs failures for optional services
- **Real Error Scenarios**: Tests validate actual error handling, not simulated errors
- **Recovery Testing**: Validates system recovery after failures

## üìà Continuous Improvement

### Quality Metrics Tracking
- **Success Rate Trends**: Track test pass rates over time
- **Performance Degradation**: Monitor response time increases
- **Coverage Evolution**: Ensure coverage improves with new features
- **Security Compliance**: Maintain 100% security test pass rate

### Test Enhancement Guidelines
1. **Add Tests for New Features**: Every new feature requires comprehensive tests
2. **Real-World Scenarios**: Tests should mirror actual user behavior
3. **Edge Case Coverage**: Test boundary conditions and error states
4. **Performance Baselines**: Establish and maintain performance benchmarks
5. **Security First**: Security tests are non-negotiable and must pass
