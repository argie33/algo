# Resource Leak Fixes for Jest Worker Process Warning

## Issue Summary

The tests were showing this warning:
```
A worker process has failed to exit gracefully and has been force exited. This is likely caused by tests leaking due to improper teardown. Try running with --detectOpenHandles to find leaks. Active timers can also cause this, ensure that .unref() was called on them.
```

This indicates resource leaks (primarily timers and intervals) that were preventing Jest from exiting cleanly.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Interval timers not being properly cleared** in background services
2. **setTimeout promises** not being cleaned up in timeout utilities
3. **EventEmitter listeners** accumulating without proper cleanup
4. **Circuit breaker timers** not being tracked or cleaned up
5. **Performance monitoring intervals** running indefinitely

## Files Fixed

### 1. `/utils/performanceMonitor.js`
**Issues Fixed:**
- 3 `setInterval` calls (system metrics, cleanup, alerts) were never cleared
- No cleanup method existed
- Timer references not tracked

**Changes Made:**
- Added timer reference tracking (`this.timers` object)
- Created `stopBackgroundMonitoring()` method to clear all timers
- Created `cleanup()` method for complete resource cleanup
- Added `isActive` flag to prevent double initialization
- Clear all Maps and arrays in cleanup

### 2. `/utils/realTimeDataFeed.js`
**Issues Fixed:**
- `dataUpdateInterval` was cleared but EventEmitter listeners remained
- Alpaca connections and cache not cleaned up

**Changes Made:**
- Enhanced `stop()` method to clear all connections and cache
- Added `cleanup()` method with `removeAllListeners()` call
- Clear all Maps and Sets in cleanup

### 3. `/utils/realtimeDataPipeline.js`
**Issues Fixed:**
- Multiple intervals (`flushTimer`, `performanceTimer`, `adaptiveTimer`) not cleared
- EventEmitter listeners not removed
- Large arrays (latency/throughput history) not cleared
- Memory pools not cleaned up

**Changes Made:**
- Enhanced `shutdown()` method to clear all timers with null assignment
- Added comprehensive `cleanup()` method
- Clear all data structures, arrays, and Maps
- Added `removeAllListeners()` call
- Reset metrics and circuit breaker state

### 4. `/utils/timeoutManager.js`
**Issues Fixed:**
- `setTimeout` in `createTimeoutPromise()` creates active handles
- `withTimeout` didn't clear timeouts on promise resolution
- `createTimeoutFetch` had active timeouts not tracked

**Changes Made:**
- Added cleanup methods to timeout promises
- Modified `withTimeout` to clear timeout on success/failure
- Enhanced `createTimeoutFetch` with active timeout tracking
- Added cleanup method to fetch wrapper

### 5. `/utils/timeoutHelper.js`
**Issues Fixed:**
- `setTimeout` in timeout promises not cleared on resolution
- `delay()` function created untracked timeouts
- `httpRequest` had untracked AbortController timeouts

**Changes Made:**
- Clear timeout IDs immediately after promise resolution/rejection
- Added cleanup method to `delay()` promises
- Enhanced timeout cleanup in `httpRequest`
- Added `cleanup()` and `resetCircuitBreaker()` methods

### 6. New File: `/utils/resourceCleanup.js`
**Purpose:**
Global resource tracking and cleanup utility for test environments.

**Features:**
- Tracks all `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `setImmediate` calls
- Provides comprehensive cleanup of all active resources
- Supports custom cleanup callbacks registration
- Jest integration with automatic setup
- Detailed logging and statistics
- Force cleanup with Node.js handle inspection

### 7. `/tests/setup.js`
**Changes Made:**
- Import and initialize `resourceCleanup` utility
- Enhanced `afterAll` hook with comprehensive cleanup:
  - Resource cleanup first (clears all timers)
  - Database connection cleanup
  - Performance monitor cleanup
  - Timeout helper cleanup
  - Proper error handling for each cleanup step

## Testing the Fixes

Run the tests to verify the fixes:

```bash
# Run tests with open handle detection
npm test -- --detectOpenHandles

# Run specific test that was problematic
npm test tests/unit/real-timeout-helper.test.js

# Run all tests to ensure no regressions
npm test
```

## Key Patterns for Future Prevention

### 1. Timer Management
```javascript
class MyClass {
  constructor() {
    this.timers = {
      interval: null,
      timeout: null
    };
  }
  
  startTimers() {
    this.timers.interval = setInterval(() => {}, 1000);
    this.timers.timeout = setTimeout(() => {}, 5000);
  }
  
  cleanup() {
    if (this.timers.interval) {
      clearInterval(this.timers.interval);
      this.timers.interval = null;
    }
    if (this.timers.timeout) {
      clearTimeout(this.timers.timeout);
      this.timers.timeout = null;
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Promise Timeouts with Cleanup
```javascript
function withTimeout(promise, timeoutMs) {
  let timeoutId;
  const timeoutPromise = new Promise((_, reject) => {
    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Timeout')), timeoutMs);
  });
  
  return Promise.race([
    promise.then(result => {
      if (timeoutId) clearTimeout(timeoutId);
      return result;
    }).catch(error => {
      if (timeoutId) clearTimeout(timeoutId);
      throw error;
    }),
    timeoutPromise
  ]);
}
```

### 3. EventEmitter Cleanup
```javascript
class MyService extends EventEmitter {
  cleanup() {
    this.removeAllListeners();
    // Clear other resources
  }
}
```

### 4. Test Environment Resource Tracking
The new `resourceCleanup` utility automatically tracks resources in test environments. For production code that needs cleanup, register callbacks:

```javascript
const resourceCleanup = require('./utils/resourceCleanup');

// Register cleanup callback
resourceCleanup.registerCleanupCallback(() => {
  myService.cleanup();
}, 'myService');
```

## Verification

After implementing these fixes, the Jest worker process warning should no longer appear. The tests should exit cleanly without force termination.

To verify:
1. Run `npm test -- --detectOpenHandles` - should show no open handles
2. Tests should complete without timeout warnings
3. No "force exited" messages should appear

## Impact

- **Eliminated resource leaks** that were preventing Jest from exiting gracefully
- **Improved test reliability** by ensuring clean state between tests
- **Added comprehensive cleanup utilities** for future use
- **Established patterns** for proper resource management in async operations
- **Enhanced debugging capabilities** with detailed resource tracking
