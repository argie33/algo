## ✅ COMPLETED: High-Impact Test Fixes

### Scores API Tests - 100% Complete ✅
- **Status**: All 62 tests passing
- **Details**:
  - 27/27 unit tests passing
  - 35/35 integration tests passing
- **Data Loaded**:
  - Stock Scores: 3153/3168 (99.5% success)
  - Quality Metrics: 5316 records
  - Growth Metrics: 2462 records
  - Momentum Metrics: 3919 records
  - Risk Metrics: 3919 records (73.7%)

## 🔧 Root Causes of Test Failures Identified

### High Priority Issues
1. **Missing Mock Imports** (affects ~20 tests)
   - `closeDatabase` not imported
   - `initializeDatabase` missing
   - Other database utilities

2. **Mock Data Gaps** (affects ~500 tests)
   - Many routes expect data that isn't in mocks
   - Integration tests need real data loaded
   - Unit tests need comprehensive mock responses

3. **App Initialization Issues** (affects ~100 tests)
   - Test setup missing proper app initialization
   - beforeAll/beforeEach not creating app instance

### Medium Priority Issues
4. **Schema Mismatches** (affects ~300 tests)
   - Test expectations don't match route responses
   - Field names don't align with loaders

5. **Missing Error Handlers** (affects ~200 tests)
   - Tests expect graceful error handling not implemented
   - Mock error responses inconsistent

### Low Priority Issues
6. **Performance Test Issues** (affects ~50 tests)
   - Stress testing failing due to database
   - Load testing needs tuning
