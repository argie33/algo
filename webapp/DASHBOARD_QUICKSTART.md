## Dashboard Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Summary Header (Top)

Four key metrics that tell the story:

| Metric | What It Means | Good Range |
|--------|---------------|-----------|
| **Total Return** | Overall portfolio performance | > 10% annually |
| **YTD Return** | 2025 performance so far | > 5% year-to-date |
| **Volatility** | How much the portfolio swings | 10-20% is moderate |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | Risk-adjusted return | > 1.0 is good |

‚ú® **What you see**: Beautiful gradient cards with color-coded metrics

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Main Navigation Tabs (4 Sections)

#### **Tab 1: Performance & Attribution** üìà
*Focus: How are we making money?*

Shows:
- Performance breakdown (where returns come from)
- Return metrics (best day, worst day, win rate)
- Holdings table with gains/losses

**Key insight**: Identifies your top performing and underperforming holdings

#### **Tab 2: Risk Analysis** ‚ö†Ô∏è
*Focus: What are the risks?*

Shows:
- Maximum drawdown (worst loss ever)
- Risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe, Sortino, etc.)
- Drawdown progression over time

**Key insight**: Understand your downside risk and recovery potential

#### **Tab 3: Portfolio Allocation** üéØ
*Focus: How is the money positioned?*

Shows:
- Sector allocation heatmap
- Sector momentum (trending up/down)
- Correlation with market (diversification check)

**Key insight**: Spot concentration risks and sector imbalances

#### **Tab 4: Comparative Analytics** üìä
*Focus: How do we compare to the S&P 500?*

Shows:
- Alpha (are we beating the market?)
- Beta (how much more/less risky than market)
- Tracking error (how different from benchmark)
- Correlation (how we move together with SPY)

**Key insight**: Understand relative performance and market sensitivity

## Key Metrics Explained Simply

### Performance
- **Total Return**: Bottom line - how much money did we make?
- **YTD**: Performance since January 1st
- **Best/Worst Day**: Biggest single-day gain and loss

### Risk
- **Volatility**: How jumpy/stable is the portfolio? (Higher = more variation)
- **Max Drawdown**: Worst peak-to-trough loss (e.g., -18.5% from peak)
- **Beta**: Moves with market? 1.0 = same as SPY, 0.8 = less volatile than SPY

### Return Quality
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Return per unit of risk (>1.5 is professional-grade)
- **Sortino Ratio**: Return per downside-only risk (better than Sharpe for comparison)
- **Alpha**: Are you beating the benchmark? (Positive alpha = outperformance)

### Diversification
- **Effective Positions**: How "spread out" is the portfolio?
- **Top 5 Weight**: How much in top 5 holdings? (>60% = concentrated)
- **Sector Correlation**: Are sectors too similar? (>0.8 = correlated/risky)

## Reading the Dashboard: Examples

### Example 1: The Green Metrics Dashboard
```
‚úÖ Sharpe Ratio: 1.85 (Green)
‚úÖ Max Drawdown: 12.5% (Acceptable)
‚úÖ Volatility: 14.2% (Moderate)
‚úÖ Alpha: +2.3% (Outperforming)
```
**Interpretation**: Strong risk-adjusted returns with good diversification

### Example 2: The Risk Dashboard
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Max Drawdown: 28.3% (Red - High)
‚ö†Ô∏è Current Drawdown: -8.2% (Down from peak)
‚ö†Ô∏è Top 5 Weight: 72% (Red - Concentrated)
‚úÖ Sharpe Ratio: 0.95 (Decent but not great)
```
**Interpretation**: High concentration risk, current down market, need to diversify

### Example 3: The Benchmark Dashboard
```
‚úÖ Alpha: +3.2% (Beating SPY)
‚ö†Ô∏è Beta: 1.4 (More volatile than SPY)
‚úÖ Tracking Error: 8.5% (Differentiated)
‚ö†Ô∏è Correlation: 0.92 (Highly correlated with SPY)
```
**Interpretation**: Outperforming but with higher risk; consider if diversified enough

## Understanding the Holdings Table

Click a row to see position detail:

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Symbol** | Ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL) |
| **Sector** | Industry (Tech, Healthcare, etc.) |
| **Weight %** | % of portfolio in this holding |
| **Value** | Dollar amount invested |
| **Gain/Loss %** | Total return on position |
| **YTD Gain %** | 2025 performance of position |
| **Beta** | How volatile vs market |
| **Correlation** | Moves with SPY? (>0.8 = yes) |

**Example**:
```
AAPL | Tech | 18.5% | $185K | +15.6% | +4.8% | 1.2 | 0.92
```
Interpretation: Apple is 18.5% of portfolio, up 15.6% overall, beta of 1.2 (20% more volatile than market), highly correlated with SPY

## Common Questions

### Q: What does "Effective Positions" mean?
**A**: If you have 25 holdings but top 5 are 70% of portfolio, effective positions might be 8. It accounts for concentration.

### Q: Is my Sharpe Ratio good?
**A**:
- < 0.5 = Poor
- 0.5-1.0 = Fair
- 1.0-1.5 = Good
- 1.5-2.0 = Very Good
- > 2.0 = Excellent (professional-grade)

### Q: What's a good correlation?
**A**:
- < 0.5 = Independent (great diversification)
- 0.5-0.8 = Some correlation (acceptable)
- > 0.8 = Highly correlated (concentration risk)

### Q: My metrics show all zeros - what's wrong?
**A**: Portfolio likely has no holdings or insufficient historical data. Add positions and wait 30+ days for metrics to calculate.

### Q: Why is my Beta 1.4 but correlation only 0.92?
**A**: You move 40% more than the market (1.4 beta) but don't move in lock-step (0.92 correlation). You have alpha - you're making different choices than the benchmark.

## Quick Diagnostic Guide

### "My portfolio is underperforming"
1. Check Tab 1 ‚Üí Sharpe Ratio (vs market it beats?)
2. Check Tab 2 ‚Üí Beta (am I taking extra risk?)
3. Check Tab 4 ‚Üí Alpha (am I actually underperforming?)
4. Check Holdings ‚Üí Are top performers underweight?

### "I'm worried about risk"
1. Check Tab 2 ‚Üí Max Drawdown (what's acceptable to you?)
2. Check Tab 2 ‚Üí Downside Deviation (cushion above)
3. Check Tab 3 ‚Üí Concentration (is it too narrow?)
4. Check Tab 2 ‚Üí Beta (how much market risk?)

### "Portfolio seems concentrated"
1. Check Tab 3 ‚Üí Top 5 Weight (is it >60%?)
2. Check Holdings ‚Üí Any sectors >30%?
3. Check Tab 3 ‚Üí Herfindahl Index
4. Action: Consider trimming top performers, adding quality new positions

### "Volatility is too high"
1. Check Tab 2 ‚Üí Volatility (what's your target?)
2. Check Tab 2 ‚Üí Beta (am I over-leveraged?)
3. Check Holdings ‚Üí Add defensive positions?
4. Check Tab 3 ‚Üí Correlation ‚Üí Add uncorrelated assets?
