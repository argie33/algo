## Test Categories & Standards

### 🧪 Unit Tests (Target: 90% Coverage)
**Purpose**: Test individual components/functions in isolation
**Location**: `src/tests/unit/`
**Standards**:
- Every service must have corresponding unit tests
- Mock all external dependencies
- Test both happy path and error conditions
- Use AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

### 🔗 Integration Tests (Target: 85% Coverage)
**Purpose**: Test interactions between modules/services
**Location**: `src/tests/integration/`
**Standards**:
- Test API endpoints with real HTTP calls
- Test database interactions with test fixtures
- Test middleware chains
- Validate data flow between services

### 🎭 End-to-End Tests (Target: Critical User Flows)
**Purpose**: Test complete user workflows in browser
**Location**: `src/tests/e2e/`
**Standards**:
- Test critical user journeys
- Use page object model pattern
- Include accessibility testing
- Cross-browser compatibility

### ⚡ Performance Tests (Target: <1s Response Time)
**Purpose**: Validate system performance under load
**Location**: `src/tests/performance/`
**Standards**:
- Load testing up to 1000 concurrent users
- Memory leak detection
- Response time validation
- Database performance testing

### 🔒 Security Tests (Target: OWASP Compliance)
**Purpose**: Validate security controls and vulnerability management
**Location**: `src/tests/security/`
**Standards**:
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS prevention testing
- Authentication/authorization testing
- API security validation

## Test Quality Standards

### ✅ Test Requirements
1. **Descriptive Test Names**: Tests must clearly describe what they validate
2. **Independent Tests**: Each test must be able to run in isolation
3. **Deterministic**: Tests must produce consistent results
4. **Fast Execution**: Unit tests <100ms, Integration tests <5s
5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test all edge cases and error conditions

### 📊 Coverage Targets
- **Unit Tests**: 90% line coverage minimum
- **Integration Tests**: 85% API endpoint coverage
- **E2E Tests**: 100% critical user flow coverage
- **Security Tests**: 100% OWASP Top 10 coverage

### 🎯 Quality Gates
- All tests must pass before deployment
- Performance tests must validate <1s response times
- Security tests must pass OWASP compliance
- Code coverage must meet minimum thresholds

## Test Execution Strategy

### 🚀 Local Development
```bash
npm run test:unit           # Run unit tests
npm run test:integration    # Run integration tests
npm run test:e2e           # Run e2e tests (requires browser)
npm run test:coverage      # Generate coverage report
npm run test:all           # Run complete test suite
```

### 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline
```bash
npm run test:ci            # Full CI test suite
npm run test:security      # Security validation
npm run test:performance   # Performance validation
npm run test:deployment    # Deployment validation
```

### 📈 Continuous Monitoring
- Automated test execution on every commit
- Performance monitoring in production
- Security scanning on dependencies
- Test result reporting and analytics

## Test Data Management

### 🗄️ Test Fixtures
- Consistent test data across all environments
- Automated test data generation
- Data privacy compliance for financial data
- Test database seeding and cleanup

### 🔧 Test Configuration
- Environment-specific test configurations
- Feature flag testing
- Mock service configurations
- Test environment isolation

## Reporting & Analytics

### 📊 Test Reports
- HTML coverage reports with drill-down capabilities
- JUnit XML for CI/CD integration
- Performance test results with metrics
- Security scan reports with remediation

### 🎯 Metrics & KPIs
- Test execution time trends
- Test failure rate analysis
- Code coverage progression
- Performance regression detection

## Best Practices

### 💡 Writing Tests
1. **Follow the Testing Pyramid**: More unit tests, fewer E2E tests
2. **Test Behavior, Not Implementation**: Focus on what the code does
3. **Use Descriptive Assertions**: Make failures self-documenting
4. **Keep Tests Simple**: One assertion per test when possible
5. **Mock External Dependencies**: Keep tests fast and reliable

### 🔧 Maintenance
1. **Regular Test Review**: Remove obsolete tests
2. **Refactor Test Code**: Apply same quality standards as production code
3. **Update Test Data**: Keep fixtures current with schema changes
4. **Monitor Test Performance**: Identify and fix slow tests

## Financial Industry Compliance

### 🏛️ Regulatory Requirements
- SOX compliance for financial data integrity
- PCI DSS compliance for payment processing
- Data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
- Financial audit trail requirements

### 🔐 Security Standards
- OWASP Top 10 security testing
- Penetration testing for critical paths
- API security validation
- Authentication/authorization testing

## Troubleshooting

### 🐛 Common Issues
- **Flaky Tests**: Check for timing dependencies and async operations
- **Slow Tests**: Review test isolation and mock usage
- **Coverage Gaps**: Use coverage reports to identify untested code
- **Environment Issues**: Verify test configuration and dependencies
