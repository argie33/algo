# Speech Recognition Error Fix

## Issue Resolved
**Error**: `TypeError: n.isRecognitionSupported is not a function`
**Location**: `AIAssistant.jsx:368:57`

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Import/Export Mismatch**: `speechService.js` exports a factory function `getSpeechService()` that returns the service instance
2. **Direct Usage**: `AIAssistant.jsx` was importing and using `speechService` directly as the service instance
3. **Null Reference**: This caused `speechService` to be a function rather than an object, leading to `isRecognitionSupported()` being undefined

## Solution Applied
**File**: `/home/stocks/algo/webapp/frontend/src/pages/AIAssistant.jsx`

### Changes Made:
1. **Import Fix**: Changed import from `speechService` to `getSpeechService`
   ```javascript
   // Before
   import speechService from '../services/speechService';
   
   // After  
   import getSpeechService from '../services/speechService';
   ```

2. **Initialization Fix**: Added proper service instance initialization
   ```javascript
   const AIAssistant = () => {
     const { user } = useAuth();
     const speechService = getSpeechService(); // Initialize speech service instance
     // ... rest of component
   };
   ```

## Technical Details
- **Service Pattern**: The speech service uses a singleton pattern with lazy initialization
- **Browser Support**: Checks for `webkitSpeechRecognition` and `SpeechRecognition` APIs
- **Error Handling**: Proper error boundaries are in place to catch and report issues

## Verification Steps
1. ✅ **Build Success**: Frontend compiles without errors
2. ✅ **TypeScript/ESLint**: No linting errors introduced
3. ✅ **Component Integrity**: All speech-related functionality preserved

## Impact
- **Speech Recognition**: Now properly checks browser support before enabling voice features
- **Voice Chat Button**: Correctly shows enabled/disabled state based on browser capabilities
- **Error Boundary**: No longer triggered by speech service initialization
- **User Experience**: Voice features work as intended when supported by browser

## Browser Compatibility
- **Chrome/Edge**: Full speech recognition and synthesis support
- **Firefox**: Limited speech synthesis support (no recognition)
- **Safari**: Partial support depending on version
- **Mobile**: Variable support depending on device and browser

## Prevention
- Added proper service initialization pattern
- Maintained singleton behavior for performance
- Ensured all speech service calls go through properly initialized instance

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
**Build**: ✅ PASSING
**Testing**: Ready for deployment
