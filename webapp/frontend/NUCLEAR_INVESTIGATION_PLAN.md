# üîç NUCLEAR INVESTIGATION PLAN
## Systematic Attack on `use-sync-external-store-shim.production.js:17` Error

### PHASE 1: CACHE ELIMINATION üßπ
1. **Clear ALL caches completely**
   - Delete `node_modules`
   - Delete `package-lock.json` 
   - Delete `dist` folder
   - Delete `.vite` cache
   - Clear browser cache
   - Fresh npm install

### PHASE 2: DEPENDENCY DETECTIVE WORK üïµÔ∏è
2. **Find the REAL source of use-sync-external-store**
   - Check if any remaining dependencies pull it in
   - Inspect the actual network requests in F12 Network tab
   - Find which bundle file contains the shim
   - Trace back to source dependency

### PHASE 3: BUNDLE ANALYSIS üì¶
3. **Analyze production build carefully**
   - Check which files reference use-sync-external-store
   - Use bundle analyzer to see dependency tree
   - Find the exact module causing the issue

### PHASE 4: SURGICAL REMOVAL üî™
4. **Target the exact source**
   - Remove or replace the dependency that's pulling it in
   - Patch the specific file if needed
   - Test with minimal reproduction

### PHASE 5: VERIFICATION ‚úÖ
5. **Confirm complete elimination**
   - Build production bundle
   - Search all files for use-sync-external-store references
   - Test in production environment
   - Verify error is gone

## CURRENT STATUS
- ‚ùå Error still present despite removing React Query, Headless UI, AWS Amplify UI
- ‚ùå use-sync-external-store package removed but shim file still loading
- ‚ùå Caching or hidden dependency still causing the issue

## NEXT ACTIONS
1. Nuclear cache clear
2. Fresh build with bundle analysis
3. Network tab investigation to find source
4. Surgical targeting of the real culprit
