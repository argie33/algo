## How It Works

### User Flow

1. **User navigates to** `/portfolio`
2. **PortfolioDashboard component mounts** and calls `useQuery`
3. **API request** sent to `GET /api/analytics/professional-metrics`
4. **Backend calculates** all 40+ metrics from portfolio data
5. **Response returned** with organized metrics by category
6. **Component state updates** with new data
7. **Dashboard renders** with StatCard components displaying metrics
8. **Holdings table** displays position-level attribution
9. **Advanced tabs** show detailed analysis (return attribution, rolling returns, etc.)

## Support

### Common Questions

**Q: Where do the metrics come from?**
A: All metrics are calculated from portfolio holdings and historical price data in the backend API.

**Q: How often are metrics updated?**
A: By default, metrics are recalculated on each dashboard load. Real-time updates can be implemented with WebSocket.

**Q: What if my portfolio is empty?**
A: The dashboard displays gracefully with zero values and shows "No portfolio data available" message.

**Q: How do I interpret the metrics?**
A: Each metric has a standard interpretation in finance. Hover over metric cards for tooltips (can be added).
