- **Size Factor**: Small-cap premium (Banz, 1981)
- **Growth Factor**: Earnings growth predictive power (Lakonishok et al., 1994)

### 1.2 Sentiment Analysis Theory
**Academic Foundation:** Behavioral Finance Research
- **Investor Sentiment Impact**: Baker & Wurgler (2006) - sentiment affects cross-section of returns
- **Social Media Sentiment**: Bollen et al. (2011) - Twitter sentiment predicts stock movements
- **News Sentiment**: Tetlock (2007) - media pessimism affects market prices
- **Contrarian Indicators**: De Long et al. (1990) - sentiment as contrarian indicator

### 1.3 Technical Analysis Validation
**Academic Evidence:**

```

**Deployment Pattern:**
```yaml
Infrastructure as Code: CloudFormation + SAM templates
CI/CD: GitHub Actions with multi-environment promotion
Secrets Management: AWS Secrets Manager + Parameter Store
Security: WAF, VPC, Security Groups, IAM roles
Scaling: Auto-scaling Lambda, RDS read replicas
```

### 2.2 Service Architecture Patterns

**Microservices Design:**

- **Timeout Management**: Service-specific timeout configurations (5s-30s)
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback to cached data when live data unavailable
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Health Checks**: Multi-layer health monitoring with dependency validation

### 2.3 Security Architecture

**Authentication & Authorization:**
```yaml
Primary Auth: AWS Cognito JWT tokens
API Protection: Bearer token validation on all endpoints
Encryption: AES-256-GCM for API keys, TLS 1.3 for transport
