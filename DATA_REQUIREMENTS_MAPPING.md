### Critical Missing Data Sources:

#### Table 1: `quarterly_income_statement`
```
REQUIRED FIELDS:
- symbol, date, item_name, value

REQUIRED ITEMS:
- "Total Revenue" / "Operating Revenue"
- "Gross Profit"
- "Operating Income"
- "Net Income"

STATUS: ❌ MISSING OR SPARSE
- Loader exists: loadquarterlyincomestatement.py
- Data populated: ~20-30% of stocks have 5+ quarters
- Most stocks have 0 quarters of data
```

#### Table 2: `quarterly_cash_flow`
```
REQUIRED FIELDS:
- symbol, date, item_name, value

REQUIRED ITEMS:
- "Free Cash Flow"
- "Operating Cash Flow"

STATUS: ❌ MISSING OR SPARSE
- Loader exists: loadquarterlycashflow.py
- Data populated: ~15-25% of stocks
- Most stocks have 0-2 quarters of data
```

#### Table 3: `quarterly_balance_sheet`
```
REQUIRED FIELDS:
- symbol, date, item_name, value

REQUIRED ITEMS:
- "Total Assets"

STATUS: ❌ MISSING OR SPARSE
- Loader exists: loadquarterlybalancesheet.py
- Data populated: ~15-25% of stocks
- Asset growth cannot be calculated for most stocks
```

#### Table 4: `earnings_history`
```
REQUIRED FIELDS:
- symbol, quarter, eps_actual

STATUS: ⚠️ PARTIAL
- Loader exists: loadearningshistory.py
- Data populated: ~40-50% of stocks
- Need 5+ quarters for YoY comparison
```

#### Table 5: `revenue_estimates`
```
REQUIRED FIELDS:
- symbol, period, growth

STATUS: ⚠️ PARTIAL
- Loader exists: loadrevenueestimate.py
- Data populated: ~35-45% of stocks
- Often just 1 estimate, not 3-year data
```

### Data Gaps & Issues:
```
❌ CRITICAL GAPS:
- Quarterly financial data unavailable for 70-80% of stocks
- Operating income YoY growth: Cannot calculate
- Net income YoY growth: Cannot calculate
- FCF YoY growth: Cannot calculate
- Asset growth YoY: Cannot calculate
- Margin trends: Cannot calculate properly

⚠️ CALCULATION ISSUES:
- "3Y CAGR" metrics actually use 1Y growth rates (mislabeled)
- Sustainable growth rate requires payout ratio (often NULL)
- ROE trend is just current ROE, not actual trend
- Need to reconsider terminology vs. actual calculations

🔧 WORKAROUND OPTIONS:
1. Accept 50-60% NULL rate for growth metrics
2. Populate quarterly tables from yfinance API
3. Use alternative data sources (financial APIs)
4. Adjust scorecard to weight available metrics higher
```

### Sample Query to Check Coverage:
```sql
SELECT 
    symbol,
    date,
    revenue_growth_3y_cagr,
    operating_income_growth_yoy,
    net_income_growth_yoy,
    fcf_growth_yoy,
    gross_margin_trend
FROM growth_metrics
WHERE date = CURRENT_DATE
AND operating_income_growth_yoy IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 10;
```

## 3. VALUE SCORE COMPONENT

**Purpose:** Evaluate valuation multiples and intrinsic value estimates

**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL - Basic valuation metrics only, no DCF calculations

### Data Table: `value_metrics`
- **Loader:** `/home/stocks/algo/loadvaluemetrics.py`
- **Database Table:** `value_metrics` (symbol, date, 5 columns + sector)
- **Creation Method:** Direct extraction from key_metrics table

### 5 Valuation Metrics Mapped:

#### VALUATION MULTIPLES (4 metrics)
| Metric | Source Table | Source Field | Formula | Status | Notes |

| ev_ebitda | key_metrics | ev_to_ebitda | Direct from yfinance | ⚠️ PARTIAL | ~25% of stocks have EV/EBITDA |
| peg_ratio | key_metrics | peg_ratio | Direct from yfinance | ⚠️ PARTIAL | ~15% of stocks have PEG ratio |

#### RELATIVE VALUATION (implicit, not stored)
- **vs. Market:** Would require sector/index median calculations
- **vs. Sector:** Would require sector comparisons
- **Status:** ❌ NOT CALCULATED - Only absolute multiples stored

#### DCF/INTRINSIC VALUE (implicit, not calculated)
- **Status:** ❌ NOT CALCULATED - Would require:
  - Free cash flow projections (5-year forecast)
  - Terminal growth rate estimation
  - WACC calculation (risk-free rate, market risk premium, beta)
  - None of these available in current schema

### Critical Missing Components:

#### 1. Income Statement Data (for DCF)
```
REQUIRED FOR DCF:
- Net Income (annual)
- Free Cash Flow (annual, 5+ years)
- CapEx and depreciation
- Tax rates

STATUS: ❌ MISSING HISTORICAL TRENDS
- Only current values in key_metrics
- No 5-year historical data stored
- Quarterly data partially populated
```

#### 2. Cost of Capital Components
```
REQUIRED FOR WACC CALCULATION:
- Total Debt (current)
- Market Cap (current price × shares outstanding)
- Risk-free rate (10-year Treasury)
- Market risk premium
- Beta (company-specific volatility)
- Tax rate

STATUS: ⚠️ PARTIAL
- Beta available: key_metrics.beta
- Market cap available: stock_symbols.market_cap
- Risk-free rate: Would need to be loaded separately
- Market risk premium: Fixed assumption (~5-6%)
- Tax rate: Not available, would need to estimate
```

#### 3. Financial Ratios for Relative Valuation
```
REQUIRED FOR SECTOR COMPARISON:

- Industry/sector median P/B
- Industry/sector median EV/EBITDA
- Dividend yield (yield vs. sector)

STATUS: ❌ NOT CALCULATED
- No sector median calculations
- No relative scoring vs. peers
- sector field stored but not used for calculations
```

### Data Gaps & Issues:
```
❌ CRITICAL GAPS:
- NO DCF valuation calculations
- NO relative valuation vs. sector/market
- NO dividend yield calculations
- NO PEG ratio validation (requires accurate EPS growth)
- NO historical earnings trends for valuation

⚠️ COVERAGE ISSUES:
- 60% of stocks missing one or more valuation multiples
- PEG ratio available for only ~15% of stocks (requires growth rate)
- EV/EBITDA missing for many smaller stocks
- P/E ratio unreliable for stocks with negative earnings

🔧 WORKAROUND OPTIONS:
1. Calculate sector medians from available data
2. Use industry benchmarks (hardcoded or external API)
3. Implement simple DCF with conservative assumptions
4. Extend value_metrics table with calculated fields
```

### Sample Query to Check Coverage:
```sql
SELECT 
    symbol,
    date,
    pe_ratio,
    pb_ratio,
    ev_ebitda,
    peg_ratio
FROM value_metrics
WHERE date = CURRENT_DATE
AND pe_ratio IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 20;
```

### Data Sources Verification:

#### Primary: yfinance Price Data
```
✅ AVAILABLE:
- Historical daily close prices (5+ years)
- Volume data
- Returns calculations

✅ STATUS:
- Loaded for stocks with >$1B market cap
- Continuous updates available
- 99%+ coverage for liquid stocks
```

#### Secondary: earnings_history Table
```
⚠️ PARTIAL:
- Loader: loadearningshistory.py
- Coverage: ~40-50% of stocks
- Data: Last 8 quarters (2 years)
- Status: Sparse for small caps

❌ GAPS:
- Missing for 50-60% of stocks
- Limited history (2 years vs. 5+ years needed)
```

#### Tertiary: yfinance Info
```
⚠️ PARTIAL:
- Forward EPS: ~50% coverage

❌ GAPS:
- Small caps rarely have analyst data
- Forward estimates may be stale
- Recommendation data has gaps
```

### Data Gaps & Issues:
```
✅ PRICE MOMENTUM:
- 95%+ coverage for stocks with price history
- All 31 metrics calculated when price data available
- Academic methodology (Jegadeesh-Titman) properly implemented

⚠️ FUNDAMENTAL MOMENTUM:
- 40-50% of stocks missing earnings data
- Analyst recommendations/targets available for ~60% of large caps
- Expected EPS growth sparse for small/mid caps
- Price target dispersion unreliable for low-analyst-coverage stocks

🔧 RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
1. Prioritize price momentum (primary signal, high coverage)
2. Accept fundamental momentum as secondary (partial coverage)
3. Focus on earnings acceleration only for stocks with data
4. Use analyst data for large caps only
```

### Sample Query to Check Coverage:
```sql
SELECT 
    symbol,
    date,
    jt_momentum_12_1,
    risk_adjusted_momentum,
    momentum_persistence,
    earnings_acceleration,
    expected_eps_growth
FROM momentum_metrics
WHERE date = (SELECT MAX(date) FROM momentum_metrics)
AND jt_momentum_12_1 IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY jt_momentum_12_1 DESC
LIMIT 20;

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR DATA COMPLETION

### Priority 1 (CRITICAL - Affects 3+ components):
```
1. Populate quarterly_income_statement table
   - Run: loadquarterlyincomestatement.py
   - Fills: growth_metrics (operating income, net income, margins)
   - Estimated lift: +25-30% coverage on growth metrics
   - Effort: Medium (API calls + storage)

2. Populate quarterly_cash_flow table
   - Run: loadquarterlycashflow.py
   - Fills: growth_metrics (FCF growth)
   - Estimated lift: +15-20% coverage
   - Effort: Medium

3. Ensure earnings_history is complete
   - Run: loadearningshistory.py
   - Fills: quality_metrics (earnings surprise), momentum_metrics (earnings acceleration)
   - Estimated lift: +20-30% coverage
   - Effort: Low (often available)
```

### Priority 2 (HIGH - Affects 1-2 components):
```
1. Populate quarterly_balance_sheet table
   - Run: loadquarterlybalancesheet.py
   - Fills: growth_metrics (asset growth)
   - Estimated lift: +10-15% coverage
   - Effort: Medium

2. Calculate sector/market median valuations
   - Create: sector_valuation_benchmark table
   - Fills: value_metrics (relative valuation scores)
   - Estimated lift: +30-40% relative value scores
   - Effort: Medium (one-time, then quarterly updates)

3. Implement DCF valuation
   - Extend: value_metrics table with dcf_intrinsic_value
   - Requires: 5-year FCF projection, WACC calculation
   - Estimated lift: +50% value score quality
   - Effort: High (complex calculations)
```

### Priority 3 (MEDIUM - Nice to have):
```
1. Historical ROE/ROA trends
   - Create: financial_trends table (5-year history)
   - Fills: growth_metrics (ROE trend accuracy)
   - Effort: Medium

2. Options Greeks (gamma, vega)
   - Extend: momentum_metrics and positioning_metrics
   - Provides: gamma_exposure, options_skew
   - Effort: High (requires pricing model)

3. 13F filing integration
   - Create: institutional_flow table (quarter-to-quarter changes)
   - Fills: positioning_metrics (real institutional flows)
   - Effort: Very High (SEC filing parsing)
```

## ACTIONABLE NEXT STEPS

### Immediate (This Week):
1. Run discovery queries on each metric table to get exact coverage %
2. Identify which loaders are not running and why
3. Document data schema gaps in scoring engine assumptions

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks):
1. Prioritize filling quarterly financial tables (biggest impact)
2. Update loaders to run on full schedule
3. Add data quality checks/alerts to loader scripts

### Medium Term (Next Month):
1. Calculate sector benchmarks for relative valuation
2. Implement simplified DCF valuation
3. Create data completeness dashboard
