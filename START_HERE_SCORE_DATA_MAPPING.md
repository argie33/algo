## The 5 Components & Their Status

### 1. QUALITY SCORE ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL (60-70% coverage)
**Purpose:** Profitability, balance sheet strength, earnings quality, capital allocation

**Data Table:** `quality_metrics` (13 metrics)

**What You Have:**
- ROE, ROA, Gross/Operating/Net Margins (from key_metrics)
- Debt/Equity, Current Ratio, Quick Ratio (from key_metrics)
- Payout Ratio (calculated)

**What's Missing:**
- Earnings surprise (earnings_metrics table sparse)
- EPS growth stability (earnings_metrics table sparse)
- Historical ROE/ROA trends (not available)

**To Fix:** Populate `earnings_metrics` table with SEC filing data

---

### 2. GROWTH SCORE ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL (50-60% coverage)
**Purpose:** Revenue growth, earnings growth, operating leverage, growth sustainability

**Data Table:** `growth_metrics` (13 metrics)

**What You Have:**
- Revenue Growth (from revenue_estimates)
- EPS Growth (from key_metrics or earnings_history)
- Sustainable Growth Rate (calculated ROE √ó payout ratio)

**What's Missing:**
- Operating Income Growth YoY (70% of stocks lack quarterly data)
- Net Income Growth YoY (70% of stocks lack quarterly data)
- FCF Growth YoY (70% of stocks lack quarterly data)
- Margin Trends (70% of stocks lack quarterly data)
- Asset Growth (70% of stocks lack quarterly data)

**To Fix:** Populate quarterly tables (quarterly_income_statement, quarterly_cash_flow, quarterly_balance_sheet)

---

### 3. VALUE SCORE ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL (30-40% coverage)
**Purpose:** Valuation multiples and intrinsic value estimates

**Data Table:** `value_metrics` (4 metrics + 0 advanced)

**What You Have:**
- P/E Ratio (40-50% of stocks)
- P/B Ratio (35-45% of stocks)
- EV/EBITDA (25-35% of stocks)
- PEG Ratio (15-25% of stocks)

**What's Missing:**
- DCF Intrinsic Value (0% - not implemented)
- Relative Valuation vs. Sector (0% - no sector benchmarks)
- Dividend Yield (0% - not calculated)
- Fair Value Estimates (0% - not available)

**To Fix:** 
1. Calculate sector median benchmarks
2. Implement simplified DCF valuation
3. Add dividend yield calculations

---

### 4. MOMENTUM SCORE ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL (40-50% overall coverage, 95%+ price momentum)
**Purpose:** Price momentum, technical indicators, volume trends, fundamental momentum

- Expected EPS Growth (50% coverage)
- Earnings Acceleration (40-50% - requires earnings_history)

**What's Missing:**
- Option Greeks (Gamma, Vega) - not calculated
- Implied Volatility Trend - not calculated

**To Fix:** Use earnings_history table for earnings momentum (partially working)

---

### 5. POSITIONING SCORE ‚úÖ COMPLETE (80-90% coverage)
**Purpose:** Institutional ownership, insider sentiment, options flow, short interest

**Data Table:** `positioning_metrics` (36 metrics)

## Critical Data Gaps (Priority Fix List)

### üî¥ CRITICAL (Blocking 50%+ of metrics)

1. **Quarterly Financial Data Missing**
   - **Impact:** Can't calculate 50% of GROWTH metrics
   - **Tables Affected:** quarterly_income_statement, quarterly_cash_flow, quarterly_balance_sheet
   - **Current Coverage:** 15-25% of stocks have 5+ quarters
   - **Loader Scripts:** loadquarterlyincomestatement.py, loadquarterlycashflow.py, loadquarterlybalancesheet.py exist
   - **Fix:** Ensure loaders run daily/weekly on full stock universe
   - **Time:** 1-2 weeks

2. **earnings_metrics Table Empty**
   - **Impact:** Can't calculate QUALITY earnings quality metrics
   - **Current Coverage:** 0-10% populated
   - **Loader Script:** loadearningsmetrics.py exists
   - **Fix:** Populate from SEC filings or earnings estimate APIs
   - **Time:** 2-3 weeks

3. **No DCF Valuation**
   - **Impact:** VALUE score lacks forward-looking component
   - **Current Coverage:** 0% (not implemented)
   - **Requirements:** 5-year FCF projections, WACC, terminal growth
   - **Fix:** Implement simplified DCF with conservative assumptions
   - **Time:** 3-4 weeks

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH (Blocking 20-30% of metrics)

4. **No Sector Benchmarks**
   - **Impact:** Can't calculate relative valuation
   - **Fix:** Create sector_valuation_benchmark table
   - **Time:** 1 week

5. **key_metrics Incomplete**
   - **Impact:** 30-40% of metrics NULL for some stocks
   - **Fix:** Verify yfinance data availability, accept gaps
   - **Time:** Minimal

## Next Steps (Recommended Order)

### Week 1: Verification & Assessment
1. Run diagnostic queries from QUICK_REFERENCE_DATA_MAPPING.md
2. Verify which loaders are actually running
3. Check key_metrics table coverage
4. Document actual vs. expected data completeness

### Week 2-3: Quick Wins (High Impact, Low Effort)
1. Ensure loadqualitymetrics.py is running
2. Ensure loadgrowthmetrics.py is running
3. Ensure loadmomentum.py is running
4. Ensure loadpositioning.py is running (already working)
5. Populate earnings_history from available sources

### Week 4-5: Medium Priority (Medium Impact, Medium Effort)
1. Activate quarterly financial loaders
2. Calculate sector benchmark statistics
3. Verify earnings_metrics can be populated
4. Create data completeness dashboard

### Week 6+: Advanced (Lower Impact, High Effort)

## Key Insights

### The Good News
- Positioning scores have complete data (80-90%)
- Price momentum has excellent data (95%+)
- Core metrics (key_metrics) fairly complete (60-70%)
- All loader scripts exist and are defined

### The Challenge
- Quarterly financial data is severely sparse (15-25%)
- earnings_metrics table essentially empty (0-10%)
- No forward-looking valuation (DCF not implemented)
- Some scores will have 30-50% NULL values

### The Opportunity
- Filling quarterly tables would increase GROWTH score coverage by 40%
- Populating earnings_metrics would complete QUALITY score
- Adding DCF would complete VALUE score
- System is "plugged in" - just needs data flowing through
