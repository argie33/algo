## Key Statistics at a Glance

```
5 Score Components    97 Total Metrics    11 Data Tables
├─ QUALITY (13)       Coverage 40-70%     Key: key_metrics
├─ GROWTH (13)        Best: POSITIONING   Quarterly data: 15-25%
├─ VALUE (4+0)        95%+ price momentum earnings_metrics: 0-10%
├─ MOMENTUM (31)       80-90% positioning  
└─ POSITIONING (36)    Worst: VALUE (30-40%)
```

## Critical Gaps Quick List

1. **Quarterly Financial Data** (15-25% coverage)
   - Blocks 50% of GROWTH metrics
   - Fix: 1-2 weeks

2. **earnings_metrics Table** (0-10% coverage)
   - Blocks QUALITY earnings metrics
   - Fix: 2-3 weeks

3. **No DCF Valuation** (0% implementation)
   - Blocks VALUE forward-looking analysis
   - Fix: 3-4 weeks

**See START_HERE for full action plan**

## Key Metrics Summary

| Component | Status | Coverage | Primary Issue | Fix Time |
|-----------|--------|----------|----------------|----------|
| QUALITY | ⚠️ PARTIAL | 60-70% | earnings_metrics empty | 2-3w |
| GROWTH | ⚠️ PARTIAL | 50-60% | Quarterly data sparse | 1-2w |
| VALUE | ⚠️ PARTIAL | 30-40% | No DCF implementation | 3-4w |
| MOMENTUM | ⚠️ PARTIAL | 40-50% | Earnings data sparse | 1-2w |
| POSITIONING | ✅ COMPLETE | 80-90% | None - ready to use | ✅ |

## Important Notes

- **Coverage percentages** are estimates based on code analysis
- **SQL queries** in QUICK_REFERENCE are templates - adjust for your database
- **Data quality** varies significantly by stock (better for large caps)
- **All loaders exist** but may not be running on schedule
- **POSITIONING is production-ready** - other scores have gaps
