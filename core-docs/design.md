## 2. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture Pattern
The system implements a progressive enhancement lambda architecture designed for fault-tolerant deployment with graceful service degradation. The architecture consists of multiple phases starting with an ultra-minimal CORS foundation that guarantees basic functionality, progressing through service loading with fallback mechanisms, and culminating in enhanced services with circuit breakers and comprehensive monitoring.

The frontend layer consists of a React single-page application with Material-UI components deployed via AWS CloudFront content delivery network for global performance. The API layer uses AWS API Gateway with Lambda functions providing serverless compute for all business logic operations. The data layer utilizes PostgreSQL RDS with advanced connection pooling and circuit breaker patterns for resilience. Real-time capabilities are provided through dedicated WebSocket services for live market data streaming.

### 2.2 Progressive Enhancement Design
The progressive enhancement architecture enables three distinct operational phases. Phase Zero provides ultra-minimal functionality with guaranteed CORS baseline, basic Express application structure, and fundamental health endpoints that cannot fail due to minimal surface area. Phase One introduces service loading with progressive enhancement including service loader patterns, comprehensive error boundaries, and lazy initialization with graceful degradation capabilities. Phase Two delivers enhanced services with production-grade circuit breakers, real-time health monitoring, performance metrics collection, and automatic service recovery mechanisms.

### 2.3 Service Loader Architecture
The service loader pattern manages dynamic service initialization with comprehensive fallback mechanisms. Each service can be loaded with configurable retry attempts, timeout specifications, and health check validations. When services fail to load, the system automatically falls back to alternative implementations or cached data to maintain functionality. The service loader maintains a registry of active services, fallback implementations, and health check functions to ensure continuous system availability.

### 2.4 Current Deployment Infrastructure
The live production environment operates in AWS us-east-1 region with API Gateway endpoint at the configured production URL and CloudFront distribution providing global content delivery. The system uses Infrastructure as Code through CloudFormation templates with stack names including the core stocks-app-stack and webapp stocks-webapp-dev for the development environment branch. The current deployment status shows clean working tree with recent MUI and React hooks fixes committed and integrated.

### 2.5 Multi-Provider Integration Architecture
The system currently integrates with two primary financial data providers: Alpaca Markets for trading and comprehensive market data, and TD Ameritrade for additional market data and trading capabilities. The integration architecture implements intelligent failover mechanisms between these two providers, rate limiting controls, and provider-specific error handling strategies to ensure continuous data availability even when individual providers experience service disruptions. Future expansion may include additional providers such as Polygon.io and Finnhub for enhanced data coverage.
