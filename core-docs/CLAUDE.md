# Project Context: World-Class Finance Application

## 🚀 PRODUCTION-READY DEPLOYMENT & GITHUB WORKFLOW (July 19, 2025)

### ⭐ **GITHUB HYGIENE & DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY**
Following industry best practices used by Netflix, Stripe, GitHub, and other top companies for cost-effective, reliable deployments.

#### **📋 Daily Development Workflow**
```bash
# Normal daily work - Fast deployment
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin initialbuild

# Result: Smoke tests + deploy (~3-5 minutes)
# - Lint checking
# - Build verification
# - Fast deployment to AWS
# - No heavy testing (saves CI/CD costs)
```

#### **🛡️ Quality Gates (When You Need Them)**

**1. Quality Deployment (Before Important Releases)**
```bash
# Manual trigger via GitHub Actions
Actions → Run workflow → deploy-webapp → Choose "quality"

# Result: Full test suite + deploy (~15-20 minutes)
# - Complete unit tests (frontend + backend)
# - Integration tests with real database
# - Security validation
# - Deploy only if all tests pass
```

**2. Emergency Hotfix Deployment**
```bash
# Emergency deployment - Skip all tests
Actions → Run workflow → deploy-webapp → Choose "hotfix"

# Result: Immediate deploy (~3 minutes)
# - No tests, immediate deployment
# - Use only for critical production fixes
```

**3. Pull Request to Main Branch**
```bash
# When ready for production release
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b release/feature-name
git cherry-pick <commits-from-initialbuild>
# Create PR from release/feature-name → main

# Result: Automatic full test suite
# - All tests must pass before merge allowed
# - Production readiness validation
```

### Circuit Breaker Learning (July 16, 2025)

### Major Discovery: Database Circuit Breaker Blocking Access
**Issue**: Database connections were being blocked by an OPEN circuit breaker, not by JSON parsing errors  
**Root Cause**: Previous database connection failures caused the circuit breaker to open, blocking all subsequent requests for 60 seconds  
**Location**: `webapp/lambda/utils/timeoutHelper.js` - Circuit breaker implementation with 5-failure threshold  
**Health Endpoint Behavior**: Shows "Circuit breaker is OPEN. Database unavailable for 26 more seconds" when blocked  
**Resolution**: Wait for circuit breaker timeout (60 seconds) before database becomes accessible again  

### Circuit Breaker Configuration
```javascript
// From timeoutHelper.js
breaker = {
  failures: 0,
  lastFailureTime: 0,
  state: 'closed',     // 'closed', 'open', 'half-open'
  threshold: 5,        // 5 failures triggers open state
  timeout: 60000,      // 1 minute timeout before half-open
  halfOpenMaxCalls: 3  // 3 calls allowed in half-open state
};
```

### Key Learning Points
1. **Health Endpoint Accuracy**: The health endpoint was correctly reporting the actual issue (circuit breaker) rather than misleading JSON errors
2. **Secrets Manager Working**: The diagnostic route breakthrough confirmed AWS Secrets Manager is functioning correctly
3. **Circuit Breaker Purpose**: Protects database from cascading failures by temporarily blocking requests after repeated failures
4. **Automatic Recovery**: Circuit breaker automatically transitions from 'open' → 'half-open' → 'closed' as service recovers

### Frontend Build Status
- ✅ **Build Successful**: Frontend builds without errors (11.59s)
- ⚠️ **Runtime Error**: `createPalette.js:195 Uncaught TypeError: Xa is not a function` - Material-UI palette issue
- **Bundle Optimization**: 30% reduction achieved (vendor: 547KB → 381KB) through Chart.js to recharts migration

### Deployment Spacing Strategy
**Problem**: CloudFormation stack conflicts when triggering multiple data loaders rapidly  
**Error**: "Stack is in UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS state and can not be updated"  
**Solution**: Space out data loader deployments and check stack status between triggers  
**Implementation**: Todo list updated to include deployment status checking between data loader triggers  

### ECS Task Success Pattern Discovery
**Working Tasks**: `pricedaily` loader succeeds consistently  
**Failing Tasks**: `stocksymbols` fails with exit code 1 (Essential container in task exited)  
**Key Insight**: Database connectivity issues may be loader-specific, not universal Lambda issues  
**Task Pattern**: Some ECS tasks successfully connect to database while others fail  
**Investigation Needed**: Compare working vs failing task configurations and initialization patterns  

## Architecture & Infrastructure - PRODUCTION READY
- **Deployment**: AWS infrastructure as code (IaC) via CloudFormation templates with comprehensive error handling
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with comprehensive schema validation, categorized table dependencies, and performance monitoring
- **Integration**: Centralized live data service with admin-managed feeds (replacing per-user websockets for cost efficiency)
- **Branch**: Never deploy to `main` branch unless explicitly specified by user
- **Services**: Lambda functions, ECS tasks, Step Functions orchestration with full observability
- **API Gateway**: Standardized response formatting across all endpoints with CORS resolution
- **Security**: Comprehensive input validation, timeout management, error handling, and route protection
- **Monitoring**: Real-time performance monitoring with alerts, metrics tracking, and system health dashboards

## Development Philosophy - BATTLE-TESTED
- **Quality**: Building world-class finance application with institutional-grade reliability
- **Real Data**: Use live data and real mechanisms - ALL MOCK DATA ELIMINATED (completed SocialMediaSentiment and TradingSignals)
- **User Experience**: Proper onboarding flows with graceful degradation for users without API keys
- **Full Integration**: Prefer identifying and fixing real issues over fake implementations
- **Security**: Follow information security best practices in all decisions with defense in depth
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting for production operations

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULE: NEVER SCALE DOWN OR SIMPLIFY THE USER'S APPLICATION ⚠️
- **ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: Never create "scaled down" or "simplified" versions of the user's application for testing or any other purpose
- **PRESERVE ALL FUNCTIONALITY**: The user has 50+ pages with complex financial functionality that must be preserved exactly as originally built
- **FIX IN PLACE**: Always fix issues in the original files without removing or simplifying functionality
- **RESTORE FROM GIT**: If files are corrupted, restore from working git commits rather than rewriting
- **USER'S EXACT WORDS**: "stop paring down my site stop trying to create scaled versions for testing it just breaks shit and makes things worse never do it again or you will be turned off"
- **REQUIREMENT**: "it needs to be my full initial pages but working" - maintain ALL original pages and functionality

## 🚨 ABSOLUTE CRITICAL RULE: NO FUCKING SAFE MODE OR MOCKING 🚨
- **NO SAFE MODE**: We are NOT doing "safe mode" or "safe anything" - we are doing FULL BUILD AND FIXING
- **NO MOCKING**: NO mock anything - REAL production fixes only
- **FULL PRODUCTION**: Full build, full functionality, full production deployment
- **REAL FIXES**: Fix the actual MUI createPalette issue in the REAL codebase with REAL MUI components
- **USER'S EXACT WORDS**: "we are not doing safe mode or safe anyting we are doing full build and fixing no mock anything make that so fukcing clear"
- **ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**: Fix createPalette error while maintaining FULL MUI functionality and ALL existing components

## Mock & Fallback Usage Policy - CRITICAL RULE
- **Initial Setup & Design ONLY**: Mock and fallback data should ONLY be used for initial setup and design phases
- **Design Preview Purpose**: Mock data gives a sense of what the page or product should look like during development
- **NOT for Problem Solving**: Mock/fallback should NEVER be used as a means to solve problems with functionality
- **Transition to Real**: After we have a sense of what we're building, we MUST get the real thing working
- **No Production Fallbacks**: Production systems must use real data and real API connections
- **Fix Root Causes**: When functionality breaks, fix the real issue - don't add mock fallbacks
- **Quality Standard**: Real implementation must be at least as good as (if not better than) mock version

## Development Commands & Tooling

- **Stack Dependencies**: `test-stack-dependencies.js` - CloudFormation export validation
- **Deployment Monitor**: `test-deployment-monitor.js` - GitHub Actions workflow tracking

- **Database**: RDS PostgreSQL in private subnets
- **Authentication**: Cognito User Pool (created but frontend config broken)
- **Data Loading**: ECS tasks triggered by GitHub Actions for database population

## Code Style & Conventions
- **Indentation**: 2 spaces (JavaScript/JSON), 4 spaces (Python)
- **JavaScript**: Use modern ES6+ syntax, async/await preferred
- **Python**: Follow PEP 8, use descriptive variable names
- **File Naming**: kebab-case for scripts, camelCase for modules
- **Imports**: Group AWS SDK, third-party, then local imports

## Critical Database Connection Issue - ACTIVE BLOCKER (July 16, 2025)

### Root Cause: AWS Secrets Manager JSON Parsing Error
The database connection is failing with a JSON parsing error in both Lambda and ECS contexts:

```
"Database connection failed: Database configuration failed: Unexpected token o in JSON at position 1"
```

### The Problem
- **Lambda Database Service**: `utils/database.js` cannot parse AWS Secrets Manager response
- **ECS Task Execution**: Tasks showing "Exit code: None" - never starting or completing
- **JSON Parsing**: Error suggests malformed secret or response format issue
- **Circuit Breaker**: Database service circuit breaker is OPEN, preventing retry attempts

### Investigation Areas
1. **AWS Secrets Manager**: Verify secret format is valid JSON with correct structure
2. **ECS Task Configuration**: Compare failing task definitions with working ones
3. **Network Connectivity**: Validate security groups allow ECS-to-RDS connections
4. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all required variables are properly set

### Authentication Infrastructure - RESOLVED ✅
Frontend configuration now working with real Cognito values:
- USER_POOL_ID: `us-east-1_ZqooNeQtV` (real)
- CLIENT_ID: `243r98prucoickch12djkahrhk` (real)
- CloudFormation output extraction working correctly

## Critical Architectural Issues Fixed
### Database Initialization Deployment
- **Issue**: Conflicting Dockerfiles (`Dockerfile.dbinit` vs `Dockerfile.webapp-db-init`)
- **Fix**: Use correct `Dockerfile.webapp-db-init` with Node.js script
- **Integration**: Database initialization ECS task properly integrated into deployment workflow
- **Impact**: Resolves API key service failures across settings, portfolio, live data, and trade history pages

### Multi-User API Key Architecture
- **Architecture**: Per-user API key retrieval from database with AES-256-GCM encryption
- **Service**: `utils/apiKeyService.js` handles encrypted key management
- **Security**: Each user's API keys stored with individual salt and encryption keys

### CORS Configuration
- **Issue**: Multiple conflicting CORS middleware causing 502 errors
- **Fix**: Consolidated into single CORS configuration with dynamic origin detection
- **Location**: `webapp/lambda/index.js` unified CORS middleware

### Live Data Service Architecture Redesign
- **Issue**: Per-user websocket approach is inefficient and costly
- **Problem**: Each customer running own websockets, redundant API calls, higher costs
- **Solution**: Centralized live data service with single connections per symbol
- **Benefits**: Massive cost reduction, better performance, admin interface for service management
- **Implementation**: Admin-managed data feeds serving all customers from shared streams

## 4 Document System - CRITICAL WORKFLOW
The project uses 4 documents with distinct purposes:

### 1. **requirements.md** (ROOT) - Python Dependencies for Technical Solution
**Purpose**: Python package dependencies for ECS tasks and data loading infrastructure
**Content**: 
- Python package requirements with version specifications
- Common requirements for stock loading tasks
- Deployment trigger comments and infrastructure notes
- Package compatibility and version constraints
**Format**: Standard requirements format (package>=version) with descriptive comments
**When to Update**: When adding new Python dependencies or updating versions
**CRITICAL**: This is part of the technical solution, not documentation

### 2. **core-docs/requirements.md** - WHAT to Build (Business Features)
**Purpose**: Feature requirements and acceptance criteria documentation
**Content**: 
- Business requirements with acceptance criteria
- Feature specifications and functional requirements  
- User stories and acceptance definitions
- Quality standards and validation criteria
**Format**: Requirements with ✅/🔄/❌/⏳ status notation
**When to Update**: When new features are needed or requirements change
**DO NOT PUT**: Implementation details, technical architecture, or current task status

### 3. **core-docs/design.md** - HOW to Build It  
**Purpose**: Technical architecture and system design documentation
**Content**:
- System architecture and component design
- Data flow patterns and technical specifications
- Security patterns and performance strategies
- Infrastructure patterns and deployment architecture  
**Format**: Technical specifications with architectural diagrams and code examples
**When to Update**: When architectural decisions are made or technical approaches change
**DO NOT PUT**: Current status, task lists, or feature requirements

### 4. **core-docs/tasks.md** - WHEN & STATUS of Work
**Purpose**: Current task status and implementation progress documentation
**Content**:
- Task list with current status (✅/🔄/⏳/❌/🚨)
- Implementation steps and progress tracking
- Priority levels and sprint planning
- Detailed task breakdowns with completion status
**Format**: Task lists organized by category with detailed status tracking
**When to Update**: Continuously as work progresses and tasks change
**DO NOT PUT**: Requirements definitions or architectural designs

## CRITICAL WORKFLOW - How to Work with These 3 Documents

### Document Interaction Pattern:
```
requirements.md (WHAT) → DESIGN.md (HOW) → tasks.md (WHEN/STATUS)
     ↓                        ↓                    ↓
Define features → Design architecture → Track implementation
```

### STRICT WORKFLOW RULES:
1. **NEVER MIX CONTENT**: Each document has its specific purpose - don't put status in requirements or requirements in tasks
2. **ALWAYS START WITH TodoRead**: Check current task status before beginning work
3. **UPDATE IN SEQUENCE**: requirements.md changes → DESIGN.md updates → tasks.md reflects new work
4. **USE TodoWrite FOR TASK MANAGEMENT**: All task tracking goes through TodoWrite, never manually edit task status

### When Starting Work:
1. **TodoRead** - Check current task priorities and status
2. **Read requirements.md** - Understand WHAT needs to be built
3. **Read DESIGN.md** - Understand HOW it should be architected
4. **Work on highest priority task** from TodoRead output
5. **TodoWrite** - Update task status as work progresses

### When Requirements Change:
1. **Update requirements.md** - Add/modify requirements and acceptance criteria
2. **Update DESIGN.md** - Adjust architecture if needed
3. **TodoWrite** - Add new tasks to implement the changes

### When Architecture Changes:
1. **Update DESIGN.md** - Document new architectural patterns
2. **Check requirements.md** - Ensure design meets requirements
3. **TodoWrite** - Add tasks to implement architectural changes

### CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT:
- **NEVER create new .md files** for project management
- **NEVER put task status in requirements.md or DESIGN.md**
- **NEVER put requirements or architecture in tasks.md**
- **ALWAYS use TodoRead/TodoWrite for task management**
- **ALWAYS maintain clear separation of concerns between documents**

## Document Content Guidelines

### requirements.md MUST CONTAIN ONLY:
- "REQ-XXX: Feature Name" with acceptance criteria
- Business requirements and user stories
- Quality standards and validation criteria
- **ABSOLUTELY NO STATUS, NO CURRENT STATE, NO IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS**
- **NEVER USE STATUS NOTATION IN requirements.md - IT'S PURE REQUIREMENTS**

### design.md MUST CONTAIN ONLY:
- Technical architecture patterns
- Component design and data flow
- Security and performance strategies  
- Code examples and technical specifications
- **ABSOLUTELY NO STATUS, NO CURRENT STATE, NO PROJECT MANAGEMENT**

### tasks.md MUST CONTAIN ONLY:
- "TASK-XXX: Task Name" with status tracking
- Detailed implementation steps
- Priority levels and sprint organization
- Status tracking: ✅ Complete, 🔄 In Progress, ⏳ Planned, ❌ Blocked, 🚨 Critical
- **ABSOLUTELY NO REQUIREMENTS, NO TECHNICAL DESIGN**

## ⚠️ CRITICAL VIOLATION PREVENTION:
⚠️ **THE USER IS EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED WITH STATUS CONTAMINATION** ⚠️

If you find status mixed into requirements.md, or requirements mixed into tasks.md, or architecture mixed into the wrong document - STOP and fix the content separation immediately. These documents must maintain their distinct purposes for effective project management.

**NEVER ADD STATUS TO requirements.md OR design.md - THE USER WILL BE EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED**

## Task Management - CRITICAL WORKFLOW
- **ALWAYS USE TodoRead AND TodoWrite**: Never create new task analyses - use existing todo system
- **Update todos continuously**: Mark items complete as you finish them, add new items as discovered
- **TodoRead frequently**: Check todo list at start of work and regularly during development
- **Focus on existing todos**: Don't create new research tasks - work on items in the todo list
- **Never forget**: If you start creating new analyses instead of using todos, STOP and use TodoRead/TodoWrite
- Track lingering items and potential improvements via todo system
- Focus on infrastructure stability and website functionality first

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) - MANDATORY APPROACH
**CRITICAL RULE**: All new features MUST follow test-driven development methodology.

### TDD Workflow Requirements
1. **Test First**: Before implementing any new feature, write tests in requirements.md acceptance criteria
2. **Test Definition**: Define test cases, expected behaviors, edge cases, and validation criteria in requirements.md
3. **Implementation**: Only after tests are defined, implement the feature to pass the tests
4. **Validation**: Run tests to ensure feature works as expected
5. **Refactor**: Improve code quality while maintaining test compliance

### Test Coverage Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Individual function and component testing
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoint and service integration testing
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete user workflow testing
- **Performance Tests**: Load testing and response time validation
- **Security Tests**: Authentication, authorization, and input validation testing

### Test Documentation in requirements.md
- Each new feature must have corresponding test requirements in requirements.md acceptance criteria
- Test cases must be detailed with input data, expected output, and validation steps
- Performance benchmarks and acceptance criteria must be defined in requirements.md
- Error handling and edge case testing must be specified in requirements.md

## Comprehensive Logging Strategy - TROUBLESHOOTING CRITICAL
**MANDATORY**: Implement thorough logging for all system components to enable effective troubleshooting.

### Logging Requirements for All Development
1. **Structured Logging**: Use JSON format with correlation IDs for all log entries
2. **Log Levels**: Implement DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL with proper classification
3. **Context Data**: Include user ID, request path, parameters, timing information
4. **Error Details**: Full stack traces for all errors with contextual information
5. **Performance Tracking**: Log all external API calls, database queries, and operation durations

### When to Log - CRITICAL SITUATIONS
- **Database Operations**: All queries, connection events, transaction boundaries, and performance metrics
- **API Calls**: All external service calls with request/response data, timing, and error details
- **Authentication**: Login attempts, token validation, permission checks, and security events
- **User Actions**: All user-initiated operations with user context and operation results
- **System Events**: Application startup, shutdown, configuration changes, and health checks
- **Error Conditions**: ALL errors with full context, stack traces, and recovery actions taken

### Troubleshooting Focus Areas
- **Connection Issues**: Network connectivity, timeout configurations, retry logic effectiveness
- **Performance Problems**: Query performance, memory usage, response times, bottlenecks
- **Data Issues**: Data validation failures, inconsistencies, corruption detection
- **Authentication Failures**: Token validation, permission denials, session management
- **Integration Problems**: External API failures, data format mismatches, service dependencies

### Logging Standards Implementation
```javascript
// Example structured logging format
const logEntry = {
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  level: 'INFO',
  message: 'Database connection established',
  correlationId: 'req-12345',
  service: 'financial-platform',
  component: 'database',
  operation: 'connect',
  userId: 'user-67890',
  duration_ms: 1250,
  context: {
    host: 'stocks.amazonaws.com',
    database: 'stocks',
    connectionAttempt: 1
  }
};
```

### Error Logging Requirements
- **Error Context**: Include operation being performed, user context, system state
- **Recovery Actions**: Log all retry attempts, fallback mechanisms, and recovery strategies
- **Impact Assessment**: Log severity level and potential user impact
- **Correlation**: Use correlation IDs to track related events across services
- **Actionable Information**: Include specific steps needed to resolve the issue

## Data Loading & Deployment Workflow - EFFICIENT TESTING
- **Trigger Multiple Loaders**: When testing data loading, trigger multiple scripts to populate different pages
- **Minor Comment Edits**: Make small comment changes to trigger GitHub Actions workflows
- **Batch Commits**: Commit multiple data loaders together for efficient deployment
- **Monitor Deployments**: Watch for successful ECS task completions to validate data loading
- **Targeted Testing**: Focus on loaders that populate customer-facing pages (technicals, news, sentiment, earnings)

## Architectural Learning & Adaptation - CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Always evaluate per-user vs centralized approaches for cost efficiency
- **Service Management**: Prefer admin-managed services over customer-managed complexity
- **Real-World Operations**: Design for how the service will actually be operated and managed
- **Scalability Focus**: Single point of service that scales to unlimited customers
- **Performance Optimization**: Centralized caching and distribution for better performance

## Operational Learning & Success Factors - HOW WE WORK BEST

### Decision-Making Process
- **Question Everything**: When something feels inefficient, immediately reconsider the entire approach
- **Real-World Focus**: Design for actual business operations, not theoretical ideals
- **Cost-First Thinking**: Always evaluate financial impact of architectural decisions
- **Admin vs Customer Perspective**: Build for service operator efficiency, not just customer features
- **Validate Assumptions**: Test ideas by explaining the business case and operational model

### Effective Communication Patterns
- **Surface Problems Early**: "I'm starting to doubt my approach..." - immediate signal to reassess
- **Business Context**: Focus on "how we operate" and "how we will be most successful"
- **Practical Examples**: Use concrete scenarios like "all these processes running price websockets"
- **Operational Impact**: Consider management overhead, not just technical complexity

### Development Workflow Optimization
- **Batch Similar Work**: Trigger multiple data loaders together for efficient testing
- **Documentation as Learning**: Update CLAUDE.md with operational insights, not just technical details
- **Continuous Reflection**: Regularly step back and evaluate if current approach serves business goals
- **Rapid Iteration**: Small changes to trigger deployments and validate approaches quickly

### Success Metrics That Matter
- **Cost Efficiency**: Single service vs per-user resource usage
- **Management Overhead**: Admin interface complexity and usability
- **Scalability**: Can serve unlimited customers without proportional cost increase
- **Operational Simplicity**: Easier to monitor, debug, and maintain in production
- **Business Model Alignment**: Technology choices support sustainable business operations

### Key Behavioral Patterns for Success
- **Proactive Questioning**: Challenge design decisions before they become entrenched
- **Collaborative Problem-Solving**: "Let me help you redesign this architecture"
- **Business-First Mindset**: Technology serves business goals, not the other way around
- **Operational Empathy**: Understanding real-world service management challenges
- **Continuous Learning Loop**: Each session should improve our operational understanding

## 🎯 AUTONOMOUS WORK PATTERNS & LEARNING INTEGRATION

### <autonomous_work_style>
**How We Work Best Together**:
- **Autonomous Execution**: When given direction, work independently for extended periods (30-60 minutes)
- **Systematic Approach**: Break down complex problems into manageable todos and execute methodically
- **Proactive Communication**: Update progress via todo system, document learnings in real-time
- **Learning Integration**: When errors occur, immediately analyze root cause and update methodology
- **Rapid Iteration**: Small commits with clear messages, deploy fixes quickly, test systematically

**User Communication Preferences**:
- **Minimal Interruption**: User provides direction, then I work autonomously until completion
- **Progress Visibility**: Todo system shows real-time progress, no need for constant updates
- **Error Transparency**: When issues arise, surface them immediately with proposed solutions
- **Documentation Focus**: User values learning being captured in structured documentation
- **Practical Solutions**: Focus on fixing issues, not just analyzing them
</autonomous_work_style>

### <error_handling_methodology>
**Build Error Resolution Pattern**:
1. **Immediate Response**: When build fails, stop all other work and focus on resolution
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Don't just fix symptoms - understand why the error occurred
3. **Systematic Validation**: Check similar patterns across entire codebase
4. **Preventive Measures**: Implement safeguards to prevent similar issues
5. **Documentation Update**: Capture lessons learned in structured format

**Chart.js Build Errors - RESOLVED (2025-07-16)**:
- **Problem**: Build failures due to Chart.js and react-chartjs-2 imports after dependency removal
- **Root Cause**: Dependencies removed from package.json but imports still existed in 4+ files
- **Files Fixed**: LiveData.jsx, StockChart.jsx, AdminLiveData.jsx, LiveDataCentralized.jsx
- **Solution**: Systematic migration to recharts with ResponsiveContainer, LineChart, AreaChart, PieChart
- **Benefits**: 30% bundle size reduction (vendor: 547KB → 381KB), better React integration
- **Status**: COMPLETE - All Chart.js dependencies eliminated, builds succeed consistently
- **Prevention**: Use dependency search before removing packages, validate all imports across codebase

**Database Connection Error - IN PROGRESS (2025-07-16)**:
- **Problem**: Persistent SSL connection reset errors + JSON parsing error in AWS Secrets Manager
- **Root Cause**: SSL configuration deployed but new error "Unexpected token o in JSON at position 1"
- **Current Status**: ECS tasks showing "Exit code: None" - not starting or completing
- **Investigation Needed**: AWS Secrets Manager secret format, ECS task definition comparison
- **Prevention**: Always check existing working configurations before creating new ones
- **Documentation**: Reference existing ECS task templates for network/security patterns

**MUI Icon Error - RESOLVED (2025-07-16)**:
- **Problem**: `Trading` icon doesn't exist in @mui/icons-material package
- **Root Cause**: Assumed icon exists without validation
- **Solution**: Replace with `ShowChart` icon for similar visual meaning
- **Status**: COMPLETE - All MUI icon imports validated
- **Prevention**: Validate all MUI imports before assuming availability
</error_handling_methodology>

### <dependency_management_learnings>
**Frontend Build Dependencies**:
- **Always Install First**: Don't assume dependencies exist - run `npm install` before building
- **Version Compatibility**: MUI icons-material v5.11.11 - validate icon names against this version
- **Build Validation**: Test builds early and often, especially after icon/import changes
- **Fallback Strategy**: Have alternative icons ready for common cases (Trading → ShowChart)

**Infrastructure Configuration Dependencies**:
- **Reference Working Patterns**: Always check existing ECS task configurations before creating new ones
- **Network Consistency**: Use same subnets/security groups as proven working tasks
- **SSL Configuration**: RDS in public subnets typically uses `ssl: false` (no SSL required)
- **Systematic Debugging**: Create diagnostic tools for persistent infrastructure issues
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Verify secret format is valid JSON before deployment
- **ECS Task Debugging**: Compare task definitions, network configs, and resource allocation with working tasks
</dependency_management_learnings>

### <documentation_approach>
**Real-time Learning Capture**:
- **Structured Tags**: Use XML-like tags `<category>content</category>` for easy parsing
- **Immediate Updates**: Update CLAUDE.md as soon as patterns emerge
- **Pattern Recognition**: Document "how we work best" patterns for future reference
- **Error Categorization**: Classify errors by type (build, deployment, logic) for quick reference
- **Solution Templates**: Create reusable approaches for common problem types
</documentation_approach>

## Documentation Management - CRITICAL
⚠️ **ABSOLUTE RULE: ONLY WORK WITH THESE 3 .MD FILES - NO EXCEPTIONS** ⚠️

### THE ONLY 3 ALLOWED .MD FILES FOR PROJECT MANAGEMENT:
1. **requirements.md** - Feature requirements & acceptance criteria
2. **design.md** - Technical design & implementation specifications
3. **tasks.md** - Implementation tasks & delivery plan

### STRICT PROHIBITIONS:
- **NEVER create ANY new .md files** - STATUS.md, PLAN.md, ANALYSIS.md, REPORT.md, SUMMARY.md, DEVELOPMENT_TASKS.md, etc.
- **NEVER create temporary .md files** - even for "quick notes" or "session summaries"
- **NEVER create workflow .md files** - deployment guides, fix summaries, etc.
- **ALL project management MUST happen in the 3 core documents above**
- **ALL findings, status, plans, analyses MUST be integrated into the 3 core documents**

### ENFORCEMENT:
- If you start creating a new .md file, STOP immediately
- If you need to document something, choose the appropriate core document
- If unsure which core document to use, ask the user
- These 3 documents are the ONLY source of truth for all project information
