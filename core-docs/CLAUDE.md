# Project Context: World-Class Finance Application

## ⚗️ TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT (TDD) - OUR CORE PRINCIPLE ⚗️

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Test-Driven Development is our principle to live by. Everything we build or update requires corresponding coverage in unit tests and integration tests.

### 🧪 **MANDATORY TDD WORKFLOW**

#### **EVERY feature, bug fix, or modification MUST follow this sequence:**

1. **📝 WRITE TESTS FIRST**
   - Write unit tests for individual functions and components
   - Write integration tests for API endpoints and service interactions
   - Define test cases with expected inputs, outputs, and edge cases
   - Include error handling and validation scenarios

2. **❌ WATCH TESTS FAIL**
   - Run tests to confirm they fail (proving they test real functionality)
   - Verify test coverage captures the intended behavior
   - Ensure tests are meaningful and not just passing by accident

3. **✅ IMPLEMENT TO MAKE TESTS PASS**
   - Write minimal code to make tests pass
   - Focus on meeting test requirements precisely
   - Avoid over-engineering beyond test specifications

4. **🔄 REFACTOR WITH TEST SAFETY**
   - Improve code quality while tests remain green
   - Optimize performance with test validation
   - Clean up implementation with test confidence

### 🎯 **TEST COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS**

#### **For EVERY new feature or change, you MUST create:**
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions, components, and modules in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints, database interactions, and service integrations
- **Error Handling Tests**: Test all error conditions and edge cases
- **Performance Tests**: Validate response times and resource usage
- **Security Tests**: Test authentication, authorization, and input validation

#### **Test File Locations:**
```
src/tests/unit/           # Unit tests for components, services, utilities
src/tests/integration/    # Integration tests for APIs, databases, workflows
src/tests/e2e/           # End-to-end user workflow tests
```

### 🚨 **ENFORCEMENT - NO EXCEPTIONS**

#### **BEFORE any code changes:**
- **✅ REQUIRED**: Write corresponding tests first
- **✅ REQUIRED**: Ensure tests fail initially (red phase)
- **✅ REQUIRED**: Implement code to make tests pass (green phase)
- **✅ REQUIRED**: Refactor with test coverage (refactor phase)

#### **AFTER any code changes:**
- **✅ REQUIRED**: Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
- **✅ REQUIRED**: Update existing tests if behavior changes
- **✅ REQUIRED**: Achieve minimum 90% test coverage for new code
- **✅ REQUIRED**: All tests must pass before code review/merge

### 📊 **CURRENT TEST INFRASTRUCTURE STATUS**
- **Total Test Files**: 309 comprehensive test files
- **Test Coverage**: 70% overall (target: 95%+)
- **Testing Framework**: Jest, Vitest, React Testing Library
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions with quality gates
- **Real Integration**: Tests against actual AWS infrastructure (no mocks)

### 🔧 **TDD TOOLS & COMMANDS**
```bash
# Unit Tests
npm test                                    # Run all tests
npm test -- --watch                       # Watch mode for TDD
npm test -- src/tests/unit/components/    # Run specific test category
npm test -- --coverage                    # Generate coverage report

# Integration Tests

# Test Development
npm test -- --testNamePattern="specific test"  # Run specific test
npm test -- --verbose                     # Detailed test output
```

### 🎯 **TDD SUCCESS METRICS**
- **Test Coverage**: Must maintain >90% for all new code
- **Test Quality**: Tests must validate real business logic, not just syntax
- **Test Speed**: Unit tests <100ms, integration tests <5s
- **Test Reliability**: 99%+ pass rate in CI/CD pipeline
- **Test Documentation**: Clear test descriptions and assertions

## 🚀 PRODUCTION-READY DEPLOYMENT & GITHUB WORKFLOW

### ⭐ **GITHUB HYGIENE & DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY**
Following industry best practices used by Netflix, Stripe, GitHub, and other top companies for cost-effective, reliable deployments.

#### **📋 Daily Development Workflow**
```bash
# Normal daily work - Fast deployment
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin initialbuild

# Result: Smoke tests + deploy (~3-5 minutes)
# - Lint checking
# - Build verification
# - Fast deployment to AWS
# - No heavy testing (saves CI/CD costs)
```

#### **🛡️ Quality Gates (When You Need Them)**

**1. Quality Deployment (Before Important Releases)**
```bash
# Manual trigger via GitHub Actions
Actions → Run workflow → deploy-webapp → Choose "quality"

# Result: Full test suite + deploy (~15-20 minutes)
# - Complete unit tests (frontend + backend)
# - Integration tests with real database
# - Security validation
# - Deploy only if all tests pass
```

**2. Emergency Hotfix Deployment**
```bash
# Emergency deployment - Skip all tests
Actions → Run workflow → deploy-webapp → Choose "hotfix"

# Result: Immediate deploy (~3 minutes)
# - No tests, immediate deployment
# - Use only for critical production fixes
```

**3. Pull Request to Main Branch**
```bash
# When ready for production release
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b release/feature-name
git cherry-pick <commits-from-initialbuild>
# Create PR from release/feature-name → main

# Result: Automatic full test suite
# - All tests must pass before merge allowed
# - Production readiness validation
```

#### **🎯 Deployment Types Summary**

| Type | Trigger | Tests | Duration | Use Case |
|------|---------|-------|----------|----------|
| **Standard** | Push to `initialbuild` | Smoke only | 3-5 min | Daily development |
| **Quality** | Manual "quality" | Full suite | 15-20 min | Pre-release validation |
| **Hotfix** | Manual "hotfix" | None | 3 min | Emergency fixes |
| **PR to main** | Pull request | Full suite | 15-20 min | Production releases |

#### **💡 Cost Optimization Benefits**
- **90% faster daily deployments** (3 min vs 20 min)
- **Reduced GitHub Actions minutes** (saves ~85% CI/CD costs)
- **Fast feedback loop** for development
- **Comprehensive testing when it matters**

## 🧪 REAL INTEGRATION TEST FRAMEWORK: NO FAKE MOCK BULLSHIT (July 21, 2025)

### CRITICAL TESTING METHODOLOGY: Real vs Fake Integration Tests

#### ❌ FAKE INTEGRATION TESTS (What We Replaced)
**The Problem We Fixed**: Previous "integration tests" were just unit tests with fancy names:
- Mock databases that fake success without real connections
- Fake HTTP responses that never test real API Gateway  
- Simulated AWS services that hide permission errors
- Technical Analysis unit tests labeled as "integration tests"
- Zero real infrastructure testing - all fake mock data

#### ✅ REAL INTEGRATION TEST FRAMEWORK (What We Built)
**True Integration Testing**: Tests that actually test integration with real AWS infrastructure:

### **Real Integration Test Environment Setup**
```javascript
// REAL AWS Configuration - No Mocks!
const API_BASE_URL = 'https://2m14opj30h.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev';
const AWS_REGION = 'us-east-1';
const STACK_NAME = 'stocks-webapp-dev';

// Real CloudFormation stack resource discovery
const stackResult = await cloudformation.describeStackResources({
  StackName: STACK_NAME
}).promise();

// Real database connection from Secrets Manager
const secret = await secretsManager.getSecretValue({ 
  SecretId: 'stocks-db-credentials-dev' 
}).promise();
const dbConfig = JSON.parse(secret.SecretString);
```

### **Real Integration Test Categories**

#### 1. **Real API Gateway Integration Tests**
```javascript
// Tests make actual HTTP requests to deployed API Gateway
test('API Gateway returns proper CORS headers', async () => {
  const response = await axios.options(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/health`);
  expect(response.status).toBe(200);
  expect(response.headers['access-control-allow-origin']).toBeDefined();
});
```

#### 2. **Real Database Integration Tests**  
```javascript
// Tests connect to actual RDS PostgreSQL database
const dbConnection = new Pool({
  host: dbConfig.host,        // Real RDS hostname
  port: dbConfig.port,        // Real RDS port  
  database: dbConfig.database, // Real database name
  username: dbConfig.username, // Real credentials
  password: dbConfig.password  // Real password from Secrets Manager
});

test('Database connection works', async () => {
  const result = await dbConnection.query('SELECT version()');
  expect(result.rows[0].version).toContain('PostgreSQL');
});
```

#### 3. **Real Lambda Function Integration Tests**
```javascript
// Tests invoke actual deployed Lambda functions
test('Lambda function responds to direct invocation', async () => {
  const response = await lambda.invoke({
    FunctionName: 'financial-dashboard-api-dev',
    Payload: JSON.stringify({ httpMethod: 'GET', path: '/api/health' })
  }).promise();
  
  expect(response.StatusCode).toBe(200);
  const result = JSON.parse(response.Payload);
  expect(result.statusCode).toBe(200);
});
```

#### 4. **Real AWS Infrastructure Validation Tests**
```javascript
// Tests validate actual CloudFormation resources exist
test('Lambda function exists and is active', async () => {
  const response = await lambda.getFunction({ 
    FunctionName: 'financial-dashboard-api-dev' 
  }).promise();
  
  expect(response.Configuration.State).toBe('Active');
  expect(response.Configuration.LastUpdateStatus).toBe('Successful');
});
```

### **Integration Test Environment & Setup**

#### **Test Environment Configuration**
```javascript
// Real AWS environment setup (no mocks)
process.env.NODE_ENV = 'integration';
process.env.AWS_REGION = 'us-east-1';
process.env.DB_SECRET_ARN = 'arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:626216981288:secret:stocks-db-credentials-dev';
process.env.INTEGRATION_TEST = 'true';
process.env.REAL_AWS_TEST = 'true';
```

#### **Integration Test Infrastructure**
- **Test File**: `REAL-integration-test.test.js` - 15 comprehensive integration tests
- **Framework**: Jest with real AWS SDK connections
- **Timeout**: 60 seconds per test for real AWS operations  
- **Dependencies**: axios for HTTP, AWS SDK for service calls, pg for database
- **Environment**: Tests run against actual deployed AWS infrastructure

#### **Real Error Discovery**
Integration tests properly fail with real AWS errors:
```
AccessDeniedException: User: arn:aws:iam::626216981288:user/reader 
is not authorized to perform: secretsmanager:GetSecretValue
```

This is GOOD - real tests exposing real permission issues that fake tests would never catch.

### **Unit vs Integration Testing Separation**

#### **Unit Tests** (Mocks Allowed)
- **Purpose**: Test individual functions and components in isolation
- **Location**: `tests/unit/` directory
- **Mocking**: Full mocking allowed - external dependencies, databases, APIs
- **Examples**: Technical analysis calculations, portfolio math, authentication logic
- **Speed**: Fast execution, no external dependencies

#### **Integration Tests** (NO Mocks)
- **Purpose**: Test real integration between deployed AWS services
- **Location**: `tests/integration/REAL-*.test.js` 
- **No Mocking**: Must use real AWS services, real databases, real HTTP calls
- **Examples**: API Gateway → Lambda → RDS flows, AWS service connectivity  
- **Speed**: Slower execution due to real network/database calls

### **Integration Test Deployment Workflow**

#### **Automated Test Execution**
1. **Developer pushes code** to `initialbuild` branch
2. **GitHub Actions deploys** real AWS infrastructure via CloudFormation
3. **Integration tests execute** against newly deployed infrastructure
4. **Real errors discovered** - permission issues, connection problems, deployment failures
5. **Tests report actual status** - not fake success from mocks

#### **Test Environment Isolation**
- Integration tests run against dedicated test AWS infrastructure
- Database transactions with automatic rollback for test isolation
- Real AWS credentials with proper permissions for testing
- Automatic cleanup after test completion

### **MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT: Eliminated Fake Integration Testing**
- **Before**: Technical Analysis unit tests disguised as "integration tests"  
- **After**: Real AWS infrastructure testing that discovers actual deployment issues
- **Impact**: Now catch real problems like Lambda deployment errors, database connection issues, AWS permission problems
- **Quality**: Integration tests fail authentically with real AWS errors, not fake success

**RESULT**: We now have REAL integration tests that test REAL integration with AWS infrastructure, not fake mock bullshit that hides real problems.

### Circuit Breaker Learning (July 16, 2025)

### Major Discovery: Database Circuit Breaker Blocking Access
**Issue**: Database connections were being blocked by an OPEN circuit breaker, not by JSON parsing errors  
**Root Cause**: Previous database connection failures caused the circuit breaker to open, blocking all subsequent requests for 60 seconds  
**Location**: `webapp/lambda/utils/timeoutHelper.js` - Circuit breaker implementation with 5-failure threshold  
**Health Endpoint Behavior**: Shows "Circuit breaker is OPEN. Database unavailable for 26 more seconds" when blocked  
**Resolution**: Wait for circuit breaker timeout (60 seconds) before database becomes accessible again  

### Circuit Breaker Configuration
```javascript
// From timeoutHelper.js
breaker = {
  failures: 0,
  lastFailureTime: 0,
  state: 'closed',     // 'closed', 'open', 'half-open'
  threshold: 5,        // 5 failures triggers open state
  timeout: 60000,      // 1 minute timeout before half-open
  halfOpenMaxCalls: 3  // 3 calls allowed in half-open state
};
```

### Key Learning Points
1. **Health Endpoint Accuracy**: The health endpoint was correctly reporting the actual issue (circuit breaker) rather than misleading JSON errors
2. **Secrets Manager Working**: The diagnostic route breakthrough confirmed AWS Secrets Manager is functioning correctly
3. **Circuit Breaker Purpose**: Protects database from cascading failures by temporarily blocking requests after repeated failures
4. **Automatic Recovery**: Circuit breaker automatically transitions from 'open' → 'half-open' → 'closed' as service recovers

### Frontend Build & Error Resolution Workflow

#### **🎨 Frontend Development Standards**:
- **Build Requirements**: All MUI components must use verified icon names from @mui/icons-material
- **Bundle Optimization**: Prefer lighter alternatives (recharts over Chart.js) for better performance
- **Error Boundaries**: Implement comprehensive error handling to prevent application crashes
- **Theme Safety**: Use safeTheme.js patterns to prevent MUI createPalette runtime errors

#### **🔧 Frontend Troubleshooting Workflow**:
```bash
# Check build errors
npm run build

# Common fixes for MUI issues:
# 1. Verify icon imports exist in @mui/icons-material
# 2. Check theme configuration in safeTheme.js
# 3. Validate Tailwind CSS color palette availability

# Test frontend changes
npm run dev  # Verify in development
npm test     # Run frontend test suite
```

### CloudFormation Infrastructure Status (July 20, 2025) - CRITICAL FIXES
- ✅ **S3 Bucket Policy RESOLVED**: Fixed "Policy has invalid resource" error by using proper CloudFormation ARN references
- ✅ **IAM Role Dependencies**: Fixed GitHubActionsTestResultsRole and LambdaExecutionRole policy ARN format issues
- ✅ **Test Results Infrastructure**: S3 test results bucket now properly configured with public read access
- ✅ **CloudFormation Deployment**: Should now succeed with corrected S3 bucket policy resource references
- ✅ **GitHub Actions Integration**: Test results upload infrastructure properly configured
- **Key Fix**: Changed hardcoded ARNs to `!GetAtt TestResultsBucket.Arn` and `!Sub '${TestResultsBucket.Arn}/*'`

### Deployment Spacing Strategy
**Problem**: CloudFormation stack conflicts when triggering multiple data loaders rapidly  
**Error**: "Stack is in UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS state and can not be updated"  
**Solution**: Space out data loader deployments and check stack status between triggers  
**Implementation**: Todo list updated to include deployment status checking between data loader triggers  

### ECS Task Success Pattern Discovery
**Working Tasks**: `pricedaily` loader succeeds consistently  
**Failing Tasks**: `stocksymbols` fails with exit code 1 (Essential container in task exited)  
**Key Insight**: Database connectivity issues may be loader-specific, not universal Lambda issues  
**Task Pattern**: Some ECS tasks successfully connect to database while others fail  
**Investigation Needed**: Compare working vs failing task configurations and initialization patterns  

## Architecture & Infrastructure - PRODUCTION READY
- **Deployment**: AWS infrastructure as code (IaC) via CloudFormation templates with comprehensive error handling
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with comprehensive schema validation, categorized table dependencies, and performance monitoring
- **Integration**: Centralized live data service with admin-managed feeds (replacing per-user websockets for cost efficiency)
- **Branch**: Never deploy to `main` branch unless explicitly specified by user
- **Services**: Lambda functions, ECS tasks, Step Functions orchestration with full observability
- **API Gateway**: Standardized response formatting across all endpoints with CORS resolution
- **Security**: Comprehensive input validation, timeout management, error handling, and route protection
- **Monitoring**: Real-time performance monitoring with alerts, metrics tracking, and system health dashboards

## Development Philosophy - BATTLE-TESTED
- **Quality**: Building world-class finance application with institutional-grade reliability
- **Real Data**: Use live data and real mechanisms - ALL MOCK DATA ELIMINATED (completed SocialMediaSentiment and TradingSignals)
- **User Experience**: Proper onboarding flows with graceful degradation for users without API keys
- **Full Integration**: Prefer identifying and fixing real issues over fake implementations
- **Security**: Follow information security best practices in all decisions with defense in depth
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting for production operations

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULE: NEVER SCALE DOWN OR SIMPLIFY THE USER'S APPLICATION ⚠️
- **ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: Never create "scaled down" or "simplified" versions of the user's application for testing or any other purpose
- **PRESERVE ALL FUNCTIONALITY**: The user has 50+ pages with complex financial functionality that must be preserved exactly as originally built
- **FIX IN PLACE**: Always fix issues in the original files without removing or simplifying functionality
- **RESTORE FROM GIT**: If files are corrupted, restore from working git commits rather than rewriting
- **USER'S EXACT WORDS**: "stop paring down my site stop trying to create scaled versions for testing it just breaks shit and makes things worse never do it again or you will be turned off"
- **REQUIREMENT**: "it needs to be my full initial pages but working" - maintain ALL original pages and functionality

## 🚨 ABSOLUTE CRITICAL RULE: NO FUCKING SAFE MODE OR MOCKING 🚨
- **NO SAFE MODE**: We are NOT doing "safe mode" or "safe anything" - we are doing FULL BUILD AND FIXING
- **NO MOCKING**: NO mock anything - REAL production fixes only
- **FULL PRODUCTION**: Full build, full functionality, full production deployment
- **REAL FIXES**: Fix the actual MUI createPalette issue in the REAL codebase with REAL MUI components
- **USER'S EXACT WORDS**: "we are not doing safe mode or safe anyting we are doing full build and fixing no mock anything make that so fukcing clear"
- **ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**: Fix createPalette error while maintaining FULL MUI functionality and ALL existing components

## 🔥 IMPLEMENTATION PHILOSOPHY: COMPLEX ONLY, NO SIMPLE/SAFE BULLSHIT 🔥

### ❌ ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN: Simple, Safe, Lite, Basic, or Minimal Implementations
**CRITICAL RULE**: We build COMPLEX, SOPHISTICATED, PRODUCTION-GRADE implementations ONLY. We troubleshoot until they work.

#### **NEVER CREATE OR USE:**
- **Simple* versions** - StockDetailSimple.jsx, Portfolio-Simple.jsx, simpleAlpacaWebSocket.js
- **Safe* implementations** - SafeTheme.js, SafeComponentWrapper.jsx, safe anything
- **Lite/Basic versions** - StockDetailLite.jsx, index-basic.css, basic anything  
- **Minimal implementations** - MinimalThemeContext.jsx, minimal-smoke.test.jsx
- **Fallback modes** - emergency fallbacks, degraded functionality, reduced features
- **Mock/fake services** - fake data, mock APIs, test stubs in production code
- **Simplified debugging** - scaled down versions for testing or troubleshooting

#### **ONLY BUILD:**
- **Complex, sophisticated implementations** with full functionality
- **Production-grade services** - alpacaWebSocketService.js (22KB), EnhancedAsyncErrorBoundary.jsx (23KB)
- **Real API integrations** - actual broker connections, live data streams, real authentication
- **Comprehensive error handling** - correlation IDs, offline handling, user-friendly errors
- **Advanced features** - HFT-ready services, enterprise-grade security, performance optimization

### 🛠️ TROUBLESHOOTING PHILOSOPHY: FIX UNTIL IT WORKS
**USER'S EXACT WORDS**: "we troubleshoot until we get it fixed"

#### **When Complex Implementations Break:**
1. **NEVER simplify or create safe versions** - Fix the complex implementation
2. **DEBUG SYSTEMATICALLY** - Use logging, error analysis, root cause investigation  
3. **PRESERVE ALL FUNCTIONALITY** - Maintain every feature while fixing issues
4. **UPGRADE, DON'T DOWNGRADE** - Move from simple to complex, never the reverse
5. **REAL FIXES ONLY** - Address actual root causes, not symptoms

#### **Troubleshooting Workflow:**
```bash
# CORRECT: Fix the complex implementation
1. Identify error in complex service (e.g., alpacaWebSocketService.js)
2. Add comprehensive logging and debugging
3. Fix the root cause while preserving all functionality
4. Test until the complex version works perfectly

# WRONG: Create simplified version
❌ NEVER: Create simpleWebSocketService.js because complex one has issues
❌ NEVER: Create SafePortfolio.jsx because Portfolio.jsx has errors
❌ NEVER: Use fallback themes because MUI theme has problems
```

### 🎯 IMPLEMENTATION QUALITY STANDARDS
- **Minimum Complexity**: Every implementation must have substantial functionality
- **Real Integration**: Must connect to actual services, APIs, databases
- **Production Ready**: Must handle errors, edge cases, performance requirements
- **Enterprise Grade**: Security, monitoring, logging, recovery mechanisms
- **User Experience**: Sophisticated UIs with comprehensive functionality

### 🚨 ENFORCEMENT: NO EXCEPTIONS
- **Code Review**: Any simple/safe implementation will be rejected and upgraded to complex
- **Architecture**: Design for sophistication first, troubleshoot complexity issues
- **Testing**: Test complex implementations, never create simple versions for testing
- **Documentation**: Document complex architectures, troubleshooting approaches
- **Philosophy**: Enterprise-grade implementations with robust error handling

## Mock & Fallback Usage Policy - CRITICAL RULE
- **Initial Setup & Design ONLY**: Mock and fallback data should ONLY be used for initial setup and design phases
- **Design Preview Purpose**: Mock data gives a sense of what the page or product should look like during development
- **NOT for Problem Solving**: Mock/fallback should NEVER be used as a means to solve problems with functionality
- **Transition to Real**: After we have a sense of what we're building, we MUST get the real thing working
- **No Production Fallbacks**: Production systems must use real data and real API connections
- **Fix Root Causes**: When functionality breaks, fix the real issue - don't add mock fallbacks
- **Quality Standard**: Real implementation must be at least as good as (if not better than) mock version

## Development Commands & Tooling
### Backend (Lambda/API)
- **Test**: `npm test` (in webapp/lambda/)
- **Package**: `npm run package` 
- **Deploy**: `npm run deploy-package`

- **Data Loading**: ECS tasks triggered by GitHub Actions for database population

## Code Style & Conventions
- **Indentation**: 2 spaces (JavaScript/JSON), 4 spaces (Python)
- **JavaScript**: Use modern ES6+ syntax, async/await preferred
- **Python**: Follow PEP 8, use descriptive variable names
- **File Naming**: kebab-case for scripts, camelCase for modules
- **Imports**: Group AWS SDK, third-party, then local imports

## Critical Database Connection Issue - ACTIVE BLOCKER (July 16, 2025)

### Root Cause: AWS Secrets Manager JSON Parsing Error
The database connection is failing with a JSON parsing error in both Lambda and ECS contexts:

```
"Database connection failed: Database configuration failed: Unexpected token o in JSON at position 1"
```

### The Problem
- **Lambda Database Service**: `utils/database.js` cannot parse AWS Secrets Manager response
- **ECS Task Execution**: Tasks showing "Exit code: None" - never starting or completing
- **JSON Parsing**: Error suggests malformed secret or response format issue
- **Circuit Breaker**: Database service circuit breaker is OPEN, preventing retry attempts

### Investigation Areas
1. **AWS Secrets Manager**: Verify secret format is valid JSON with correct structure
2. **ECS Task Configuration**: Compare failing task definitions with working ones
3. **Network Connectivity**: Validate security groups allow ECS-to-RDS connections
4. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all required variables are properly set

### Authentication Infrastructure - RESOLVED ✅
Frontend configuration now working with real Cognito values:
- USER_POOL_ID: `us-east-1_ZqooNeQtV` (real)
- CLIENT_ID: `243r98prucoickch12djkahrhk` (real)
- CloudFormation output extraction working correctly

## Critical Architectural Issues Fixed
### Database Initialization Deployment
- **Issue**: Conflicting Dockerfiles (`Dockerfile.dbinit` vs `Dockerfile.webapp-db-init`)
- **Fix**: Use correct `Dockerfile.webapp-db-init` with Node.js script
- **Integration**: Database initialization ECS task properly integrated into deployment workflow
- **Impact**: Resolves API key service failures across settings, portfolio, live data, and trade history pages

### Multi-User API Key Architecture
- **Architecture**: Per-user API key retrieval from database with AES-256-GCM encryption
- **Service**: `utils/apiKeyService.js` handles encrypted key management
- **Security**: Each user's API keys stored with individual salt and encryption keys

### CORS Configuration
- **Issue**: Multiple conflicting CORS middleware causing 502 errors
- **Fix**: Consolidated into single CORS configuration with dynamic origin detection
- **Location**: `webapp/lambda/index.js` unified CORS middleware

### Live Data Service Architecture Redesign
- **Issue**: Per-user websocket approach is inefficient and costly
- **Problem**: Each customer running own websockets, redundant API calls, higher costs
- **Solution**: Centralized live data service with single connections per symbol
- **Benefits**: Massive cost reduction, better performance, admin interface for service management
- **Implementation**: Admin-managed data feeds serving all customers from shared streams

## Systematic Unit Test Fixing Methodology - CRITICAL WORKFLOW

### 🧪 **TODO-DRIVEN TEST QUALITY APPROACH**
**MANDATORY PROCESS**: All test fixes must follow systematic debugging with root cause analysis

#### **📋 Unit Test Fixing Workflow**:
```bash
# STEP 1: Always start with TodoRead
TodoRead  # Check current test fixing priorities

# STEP 2: Identify failing test patterns
npm test -- --testNamePattern="specific failing test"

# STEP 3: Debug with comprehensive logging
# Add console.log debugging to understand error root cause
# Check mock setups, module caching, environment variables

# STEP 4: Fix entire class of issues, not just individual symptoms
# If auth test fails, fix all auth testing patterns
# If database test fails, fix all database testing patterns

# STEP 5: Update TodoWrite with progress
TodoWrite  # Mark current item in_progress, add new discoveries

# STEP 6: Document learning in appropriate docs
# Add patterns to design.md, update requirements if needed
```

#### **🎯 Critical Test Fixing Rules**:
- **Fix Root Causes**: Don't just make tests pass - understand WHY they failed
- **Systematic Approach**: Fix entire categories of issues, not individual tests
- **Comprehensive Debugging**: Use console.log, mock inspection, module cache analysis
- **Learning Integration**: Document patterns for future prevention
- **Todo-Driven Progress**: All work tracked through TodoRead/TodoWrite system

#### **🔧 Test Infrastructure Requirements**:
- **Mock Management**: Proper external dependency mocking with realistic responses
- **Module Isolation**: Clear module cache between tests to prevent interference
- **Environment Setup**: Proper browser API mocking (localStorage, window, document)
- **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive error handling in test infrastructure

## 4 Document System - CRITICAL WORKFLOW
The project uses 4 documents with distinct purposes:

### 1. **requirements.md** (ROOT) - Python Dependencies for Technical Solution
**Purpose**: Python package dependencies for ECS tasks and data loading infrastructure
**Content**: 
- Python package requirements with version specifications
- Common requirements for stock loading tasks
- Deployment trigger comments and infrastructure notes
- Package compatibility and version constraints
**Format**: Standard requirements format (package>=version) with descriptive comments
**When to Update**: When adding new Python dependencies or updating versions
**CRITICAL**: This is part of the technical solution, not documentation

### 2. **core-docs/requirements.md** - WHAT to Build (Business Features)
**Purpose**: Feature requirements and acceptance criteria documentation
**Content**: 
- Business requirements with acceptance criteria
- Feature specifications and functional requirements  
- User stories and acceptance definitions
- Quality standards and validation criteria
**Format**: Requirements with ✅/🔄/❌/⏳ status notation
**When to Update**: When new features are needed or requirements change
**DO NOT PUT**: Implementation details, technical architecture, or current task status

### 3. **core-docs/design.md** - HOW to Build It  
**Purpose**: Technical architecture and system design documentation
**Content**:
- System architecture and component design
- Data flow patterns and technical specifications
- Security patterns and performance strategies
- Infrastructure patterns and deployment architecture  
**Format**: Technical specifications with architectural diagrams and code examples
**When to Update**: When architectural decisions are made or technical approaches change
**DO NOT PUT**: Current status, task lists, or feature requirements

**Purpose**: Current task status and implementation progress documentation
**Content**:
- Task list with current status (✅/🔄/⏳/❌/🚨)
- Implementation steps and progress tracking
- Priority levels and sprint planning
- Detailed task breakdowns with completion status
**Format**: Task lists organized by category with detailed status tracking
**When to Update**: Continuously as work progresses and tasks change
**DO NOT PUT**: Requirements definitions or architectural designs

## CRITICAL WORKFLOW - How to Work with These 3 Documents

### Document Interaction Pattern:
```
requirements.md (WHAT) → DESIGN.md (HOW) → tasks.md (WHEN/STATUS)
     ↓                        ↓                    ↓
Define features → Design architecture → Track implementation
```

### STRICT WORKFLOW RULES:
1. **NEVER MIX CONTENT**: Each document has its specific purpose - don't put status in requirements or requirements in tasks
2. **ALWAYS START WITH TodoRead**: Check current task status before beginning work
3. **UPDATE IN SEQUENCE**: requirements.md changes → DESIGN.md updates → tasks.md reflects new work
4. **USE TodoWrite FOR TASK MANAGEMENT**: All task tracking goes through TodoWrite, never manually edit task status

### When Starting Work:
1. **TodoRead** - Check current task priorities and status
2. **Read requirements.md** - Understand WHAT needs to be built
3. **Read DESIGN.md** - Understand HOW it should be architected
4. **Work on highest priority task** from TodoRead output
5. **TodoWrite** - Update task status as work progresses

### When Requirements Change:
1. **Update requirements.md** - Add/modify requirements and acceptance criteria
2. **Update DESIGN.md** - Adjust architecture if needed
3. **TodoWrite** - Add new tasks to implement the changes

### When Architecture Changes:
1. **Update DESIGN.md** - Document new architectural patterns
2. **Check requirements.md** - Ensure design meets requirements
3. **TodoWrite** - Add tasks to implement architectural changes

### CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT:
- **NEVER create new .md files** for project management
- **NEVER put task status in requirements.md or DESIGN.md**
- **NEVER put requirements or architecture in tasks.md**
- **ALWAYS use TodoRead/TodoWrite for task management**
- **ALWAYS maintain clear separation of concerns between documents**

## Document Content Guidelines

### requirements.md MUST CONTAIN ONLY:
- "REQ-XXX: Feature Name" with acceptance criteria
- Business requirements and user stories
- Quality standards and validation criteria
- **ABSOLUTELY NO STATUS, NO CURRENT STATE, NO IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS**
- **NEVER USE STATUS NOTATION IN requirements.md - IT'S PURE REQUIREMENTS**

### design.md MUST CONTAIN ONLY:
- Technical architecture patterns
- Component design and data flow
- Security and performance strategies  
- Code examples and technical specifications
- **ABSOLUTELY NO STATUS, NO CURRENT STATE, NO PROJECT MANAGEMENT**

### tasks.md MUST CONTAIN ONLY:
- "TASK-XXX: Task Name" with status tracking
- Detailed implementation steps
- Priority levels and sprint organization
- Status tracking: ✅ Complete, 🔄 In Progress, ⏳ Planned, ❌ Blocked, 🚨 Critical
- **ABSOLUTELY NO REQUIREMENTS, NO TECHNICAL DESIGN**

## ⚠️ CRITICAL VIOLATION PREVENTION:
⚠️ **THE USER IS EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED WITH STATUS CONTAMINATION** ⚠️

If you find status mixed into requirements.md, or requirements mixed into tasks.md, or architecture mixed into the wrong document - STOP and fix the content separation immediately. These documents must maintain their distinct purposes for effective project management.

**NEVER ADD STATUS TO requirements.md OR design.md - THE USER WILL BE EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED**

## Task Management - CRITICAL WORKFLOW (WITH TDD INTEGRATION)
- **ALWAYS USE TodoRead AND TodoWrite**: Never create new task analyses - use existing todo system
- **TDD FIRST**: Every todo item must include corresponding test requirements
- **Update todos continuously**: Mark items complete as you finish them, add new items as discovered
- **TodoRead frequently**: Check todo list at start of work and regularly during development
- **Focus on existing todos**: Don't create new research tasks - work on items in the todo list
- **Test Coverage Tracking**: Each todo item must specify required unit and integration tests
- **Never forget**: If you start creating new analyses instead of using todos, STOP and use TodoRead/TodoWrite
- Track lingering items and potential improvements via todo system
- Focus on infrastructure stability and website functionality first

## 🧪 ENHANCED TDD INTEGRATION WITH WORKFLOW

### **TDD + TODO INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS**
- **Every todo item** must specify what tests need to be written
- **Test status tracking** in todo items (tests written ✅, tests passing ✅, implementation ✅)
- **Test-first mindset** in all todo descriptions and planning
- **Coverage validation** before marking any todo as complete

### **TDD TODO TEMPLATE**
```
TodoWrite: "Fix component X behavior"
Required Tests:
- Unit: Test component X with props A, B, C
- Integration: Test component X with API endpoint Y
- Error: Test component X with invalid data Z
Implementation Steps:
1. Write failing tests for expected behavior
2. Implement minimal code to pass tests  
3. Refactor while maintaining green tests
4. Validate test coverage >90%
```

### **MANDATORY TDD CHECKLIST FOR EVERY TODO ITEM**
- [ ] **Tests Written First**: Unit and integration tests written before implementation
- [ ] **Tests Initially Fail**: Confirmed tests fail before implementation (red phase)
- [ ] **Implementation Passes Tests**: Code written to make tests pass (green phase)  
- [ ] **Refactored Safely**: Code improved while maintaining test coverage (refactor phase)
- [ ] **Coverage Validated**: >90% test coverage achieved for new/modified code
- [ ] **Integration Tested**: Real API/database integration tests passing
- [ ] **No Regressions**: Full test suite passes after changes

## Comprehensive Logging Strategy - TROUBLESHOOTING CRITICAL
**MANDATORY**: Implement thorough logging for all system components to enable effective troubleshooting.

### Logging Requirements for All Development
1. **Structured Logging**: Use JSON format with correlation IDs for all log entries
2. **Log Levels**: Implement DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL with proper classification
3. **Context Data**: Include user ID, request path, parameters, timing information
4. **Error Details**: Full stack traces for all errors with contextual information
5. **Performance Tracking**: Log all external API calls, database queries, and operation durations

### When to Log - CRITICAL SITUATIONS
- **Database Operations**: All queries, connection events, transaction boundaries, and performance metrics
- **API Calls**: All external service calls with request/response data, timing, and error details
- **Authentication**: Login attempts, token validation, permission checks, and security events
- **User Actions**: All user-initiated operations with user context and operation results
- **System Events**: Application startup, shutdown, configuration changes, and health checks
- **Error Conditions**: ALL errors with full context, stack traces, and recovery actions taken

### Troubleshooting Focus Areas
- **Connection Issues**: Network connectivity, timeout configurations, retry logic effectiveness
- **Performance Problems**: Query performance, memory usage, response times, bottlenecks
- **Data Issues**: Data validation failures, inconsistencies, corruption detection
- **Authentication Failures**: Token validation, permission denials, session management
- **Integration Problems**: External API failures, data format mismatches, service dependencies

### Logging Standards Implementation
```javascript
// Example structured logging format
const logEntry = {
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  level: 'INFO',
  message: 'Database connection established',
  correlationId: 'req-12345',
  service: 'financial-platform',
  component: 'database',
  operation: 'connect',
  userId: 'user-67890',
  duration_ms: 1250,
  context: {
    host: 'stocks.amazonaws.com',
    database: 'stocks',
    connectionAttempt: 1
  }
};
```

### Error Logging Requirements
- **Error Context**: Include operation being performed, user context, system state
- **Recovery Actions**: Log all retry attempts, fallback mechanisms, and recovery strategies
- **Impact Assessment**: Log severity level and potential user impact
- **Correlation**: Use correlation IDs to track related events across services
- **Actionable Information**: Include specific steps needed to resolve the issue

## Data Loading & Deployment Workflow - EFFICIENT TESTING

### <error_handling_methodology>
**Build Error Resolution Pattern**:
1. **Immediate Response**: When build fails, stop all other work and focus on resolution
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Don't just fix symptoms - understand why the error occurred
3. **Systematic Validation**: Check similar patterns across entire codebase
4. **Preventive Measures**: Implement safeguards to prevent similar issues
5. **Documentation Update**: Capture lessons learned in structured format

**Chart.js Build Errors - RESOLVED (2025-07-16)**:
- **Problem**: Build failures due to Chart.js and react-chartjs-2 imports after dependency removal
- **Root Cause**: Dependencies removed from package.json but imports still existed in 4+ files
- **Files Fixed**: LiveData.jsx, StockChart.jsx, AdminLiveData.jsx, LiveDataCentralized.jsx
- **Solution**: Systematic migration to recharts with ResponsiveContainer, LineChart, AreaChart, PieChart
- **Benefits**: 30% bundle size reduction (vendor: 547KB → 381KB), better React integration
- **Status**: COMPLETE - All Chart.js dependencies eliminated, builds succeed consistently
- **Prevention**: Use dependency search before removing packages, validate all imports across codebase

**Database Connection Error - IN PROGRESS (2025-07-16)**:
- **Problem**: Persistent SSL connection reset errors + JSON parsing error in AWS Secrets Manager
- **Root Cause**: SSL configuration deployed but new error "Unexpected token o in JSON at position 1"
- **Current Status**: ECS tasks showing "Exit code: None" - not starting or completing
- **Investigation Needed**: AWS Secrets Manager secret format, ECS task definition comparison
- **Prevention**: Always check existing working configurations before creating new ones
- **Documentation**: Reference existing ECS task templates for network/security patterns

**MUI Icon Error - RESOLVED (2025-07-16)**:
- **Problem**: `Trading` icon doesn't exist in @mui/icons-material package
- **Root Cause**: Assumed icon exists without validation
- **Solution**: Replace with `ShowChart` icon for similar visual meaning
- **Status**: COMPLETE - All MUI icon imports validated
- **Prevention**: Validate all MUI imports before assuming availability
</error_handling_methodology>

### <dependency_management_learnings>
**Frontend Build Dependencies**:
- **Always Install First**: Don't assume dependencies exist - run `npm install` before building
- **Version Compatibility**: MUI icons-material v5.11.11 - validate icon names against this version
- **Build Validation**: Test builds early and often, especially after icon/import changes
- **Fallback Strategy**: Have alternative icons ready for common cases (Trading → ShowChart)

**Infrastructure Configuration Dependencies**:
- **Reference Working Patterns**: Always check existing ECS task configurations before creating new ones
- **Network Consistency**: Use same subnets/security groups as proven working tasks
- **SSL Configuration**: RDS in public subnets typically uses `ssl: false` (no SSL required)
- **Systematic Debugging**: Create diagnostic tools for persistent infrastructure issues
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Verify secret format is valid JSON before deployment
- **ECS Task Debugging**: Compare task definitions, network configs, and resource allocation with working tasks
</dependency_management_learnings>

### <documentation_approach>
**Real-time Learning Capture**:
- **Structured Tags**: Use XML-like tags `<category>content</category>` for easy parsing
- **Immediate Updates**: Update CLAUDE.md as soon as patterns emerge
- **Pattern Recognition**: Document "how we work best" patterns for future reference
- **Error Categorization**: Classify errors by type (build, deployment, logic) for quick reference
- **Solution Templates**: Create reusable approaches for common problem types
</documentation_approach>

## Documentation Management - CRITICAL
⚠️ **ABSOLUTE RULE: ONLY WORK WITH THESE 3 .MD FILES - NO EXCEPTIONS** ⚠️

### THE ONLY 3 ALLOWED .MD FILES FOR PROJECT MANAGEMENT:
1. **requirements.md** - Feature requirements & acceptance criteria
2. **design.md** - Technical design & implementation specifications
3. **tasks.md** - Implementation tasks & delivery plan

### STRICT PROHIBITIONS:
- **NEVER create ANY new .md files** - STATUS.md, PLAN.md, ANALYSIS.md, REPORT.md, SUMMARY.md, DEVELOPMENT_TASKS.md, etc.
- **NEVER create temporary .md files** - even for "quick notes" or "session summaries"
- **NEVER create workflow .md files** - deployment guides, fix summaries, etc.
- **ALL project management MUST happen in the 3 core documents above**
- **ALL findings, status, plans, analyses MUST be integrated into the 3 core documents**

### ENFORCEMENT:
- If you start creating a new .md file, STOP immediately
- If you need to document something, choose the appropriate core document
- If unsure which core document to use, ask the user
- These 3 documents are the ONLY source of truth for all project information
