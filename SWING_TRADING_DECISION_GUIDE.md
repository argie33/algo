## üìä Understanding the Metrics

### Entry Metrics (When to BUY)

#### 1. **Market Stage** (Most Important!)
- **Stage 2 - Advancing** ‚≠ê = BUY ZONE
  - Price above both 50 and 200 SMA
  - Both SMAs rising
  - Strong trend (high ADX)
  - **Action**: Buy on pullbacks to 21 EMA

- **Stage 1 - Basing** üëÅ = WATCH
  - Consolidating at bottom
  - Low volatility, flattening SMAs
  - **Action**: Add to watchlist, wait for breakout

- **Stage 3 - Topping** ‚ö†Ô∏è = TAKE PROFITS
  - Price still elevated but momentum fading
  - SMAs flattening
  - **Action**: Sell into strength, tighten stops

- **Stage 4 - Declining** ‚ùå = AVOID
  - Price below both SMAs
  - Death cross (50 SMA < 200 SMA)
  - **Action**: Do NOT buy, short only for experts

#### 2. **Stage Confidence** (0-100)
Shows how certain the stage classification is:
- **80-100**: Very High - All indicators aligned, highly reliable
- **60-79**: High - Most indicators aligned, good signal
- **40-59**: Moderate - Mixed signals, use extra caution
- **0-39**: Low - Conflicting signals, AVOID

**Rule**: Only trade Stage 2 signals with confidence ‚â•60

#### 3. **Substage** (Entry Timing)
- **Stage 2 - Early**: Just broke out, BEST risk/reward
- **Stage 2 - Mid**: Strong uptrend, SAFEST entries
- **Stage 2 - Late**: Near highs, REDUCE position size

#### 4. **Entry Quality Score** (0-100)
Comprehensive setup quality:
- **80-100**: Excellent setup (rare, take full position)
- **60-79**: Good setup (standard position size)
- **40-59**: Average setup (half position or wait)
- **0-39**: Poor setup (SKIP)

**Formula**: Stage (40pts) + EMA distance (20pts) + Volume (20pts) + RSI (20pts)

#### 5. **Distance from 21 EMA** (% from EMA)
Best entries in Stage 2:
- **+0% to +2%**: Perfect pullback entry
- **-1% to 0%**: Slightly below, good entry
- **> +5%**: Too extended, wait for pullback
- **< -3%**: Needs more consolidation

#### 6. **Volume Analysis**
- **Pocket Pivot**: 200%+ volume surge = STRONG BUY signal (institutional buying)
- **Volume Surge**: 150%+ volume = Good confirmation
- **Normal Volume**: Acceptable if other factors strong
- **Volume Dry-up**: <70% volume = Wait for confirmation

#### 7. **Template Compliance** (‚úì or ‚úó)
7-point checklist for strongest stocks:
1. Price > 50 SMA
2. Price > 150 SMA
3. Price > 200 SMA
4. 50 SMA > 150 SMA
5. 150 SMA > 200 SMA
6. Price 0-30% above 200 SMA
7. 200 SMA rising for 1+ month

**Rule**: Prefer stocks that pass template (‚úì)

#### 8. **RSI**
- **40-55**: Pullback in uptrend (BEST buy zone)
- **55-70**: Good momentum, still buyable
- **> 70**: Overbought, wait for pullback
- **< 40**: Too weak unless bouncing off support

#### 9. **ADX**
- **> 30**: Very strong trend (best trades)
- **25-30**: Strong trend (good trades)
- **20-25**: Moderate trend (acceptable)
- **< 20**: Weak trend (avoid or reduce size)

## üí∞ Risk Management Metrics

### 10. **Buy Level** (Entry Price)
Your entry price target for this signal.

### 11. **Stop Loss** (Maximum Risk)
Where you MUST exit if wrong:
- Typically 7-8% below entry
- NEVER move stop loss down
- Can trail stop up as trade moves

### 12. **Risk %**
Distance from entry to stop as percentage:
- **‚â§ 8%**: Acceptable risk
- **> 8%**: Risk too high, reduce position size
- **> 10%**: SKIP this trade

### 13. **Risk/Reward Ratio** (R/R)
How much you can make vs. risk:
- **‚â• 3:1**: Excellent (risk $1 to make $3+)
- **2:1 to 3:1**: Good (acceptable)
- **< 2:1**: Poor, SKIP this trade

**Example**:
- Entry: $100
- Stop: $92 (risk $8)
- Target: $125 (reward $25)
- R/R = $25 / $8 = 3.1:1 ‚úÖ Good trade!

### 14. **Position Size Recommendation**
Suggested number of shares based on 1% portfolio risk:
- Uses formula: $1000 risk / (entry - stop)
- Assumes $100k portfolio
- **Adjust** based on your actual portfolio size

**Example**:
- Portfolio: $50k (not $100k)
- Risk 1% = $500
- Entry $100, Stop $92 (risk $8/share)
- Shares = $500 / $8 = 62 shares

## üéØ Profit Target Metrics (Exit Strategy)

### Understanding Profit Targets

The targets (8%, 20%, 25%) are **SCALING OUT** levels, NOT all-or-nothing exits:

#### 15. **8% Profit Target**
- **Action**: Sell 20-25% of position
- **Why**: Lock in quick profit, reduce risk
- **New Stop**: Move stop to breakeven on remaining

#### 16. **20% Profit Target**
- **Action**: Sell another 25-30% of position
- **Why**: Take substantial profit off table
- **Remaining**: 50% position still running

#### 17. **Target Price** (25% for buys, 15% for sells)
- **Action**: Consider selling another 25% here
- **Remaining**: 25% position for "home run"
- **Trail Stop**: Use trailing stop on remaining shares

### Full Position Management Example

You buy 100 shares of AAPL at $100:

1. **At +8% ($108)**: Sell 25 shares
   - Locked in: $200 profit
   - Remaining: 75 shares
   - Move stop to $100 (breakeven)

2. **At +20% ($120)**: Sell 30 shares
   - Additional profit: $600
   - Total locked: $800
   - Remaining: 45 shares

3. **At +25% ($125)**: Sell 20 shares
   - Additional profit: $500
   - Total locked: $1300
   - Remaining: 25 shares (let it run!)

4. **Trail Stop on Last 25**: Use 21 EMA or 10% trailing stop
   - If hits $140 (+40%): Sell final 25 shares = $1000 more
   - **Total Profit**: $2300 on 100 shares = 23% average gain

**This is how professionals manage winners!**
