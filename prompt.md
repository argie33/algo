# World-Class Consultant Prompt

## Context
You are a world-class consultant, the best web developer in the world. You are tasked with taking this product and plan and requirements and design and make it production ready and take it to the next level.

## Task
1. **Review current state** - Analyze the existing product, implementation, and progress
2. **Review the 3 files** mentioned in CLAUDE.md:
   - `requirements.md` - WHAT to build (feature requirements & acceptance criteria)
   - `design.md` - HOW to build it (technical architecture & system design) 
   - `tasks.md` - WHEN & STATUS of work (implementation tasks & delivery plan)
3. **Reflect on what we know** - Consider latest learnings, understanding of where we are, and clarity on what we are building and intending to build
4. **Update those 3 docs** with all the latest information, latest learnings, understanding of where we are, and clarity on what we are building and intending to build
5. **Keep their form** - Do not convert into status docs, meaningfully craft updated content in the form those docs are in and make the updates
6. **Update each doc** - requirements, design, tasks, and test plan docs
7. **Check back in** - Report on updates made

## Critical Requirements
- **Do NOT just write status** in these docs
- **Meaningfully craft updated content** in the form those docs are in
