   - Removed weak base64 "encryption" fallback
   - Only supports proper AES-256-GCM encryption
   - No more easily reversible encoding

3. ✅ **Fixed CORS Configuration**  
   - Replaced wildcard `*` with specific allowed origins
   - Environment-based origin configuration
   - Development/production appropriate settings

4. ✅ **Sanitized Sensitive Logging**
   - Removed user emails and personal info from logs
   - Eliminated API key metadata exposure
   - Clean logging without sensitive data

5. ✅ **Removed Debug Endpoint Vulnerability**
   - Eliminated API key exposure endpoint
   - No more plaintext key decryption in responses
   - Secure debug practices implemented
