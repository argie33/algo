## 1. Database Integrity Audit

### 1.1 Duplicate Data Analysis

**Summary**: Zero duplicates found across all critical tables.

| Table | Total Rows | Duplicates | Status |
|-------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| stock_symbols | 5,315 | ✅ 0 | Unique per symbol |
| stock_scores | 2,133 | ✅ 0 | 1 record per symbol |
| positioning_metrics | 12,746 | ✅ 0 | Unique (symbol, date) |
| earnings_history | 16,768 | ✅ 0 | Unique (symbol, quarter) |

**Verification**:
- Each `stock_symbols` record has exactly one symbol
- Each stock in `stock_scores` has exactly one composite score record
- No multi-quarter duplicates in earnings data
- No date-based duplicates in positioning metrics

### 1.2 ETF Contamination Check

**Result**: ✅ All ETFs properly removed

| ETF Symbol | Records in stock_scores | Status |
|-----------|------------------------|--------|
| GLD | ✅ 0 | Removed |
| QQQ | ✅ 0 | Removed |
| IWM | ✅ 0 | Removed |
| SPY | ✅ 0 | Removed |
| VTI | ✅ 0 | Removed |

**Details**: ETFs were previously contaminating the scoring system but have been successfully removed through the updated loader (loadstockscores.py:135-153) which now uses stock_symbols table with `WHERE etf != 'Y'` filtering.

### 1.3 Data Coverage Analysis

```
Total stocks available:      5,315 (stock_symbols table)
Stocks with scores:          2,133 (40.1% coverage)

Data source availability:
- Positioning metrics:       12,746 records across 5,399 symbols
- Earnings history:          16,768 records across 4,408 symbols
- Technical data:            5,679,339 records across 1,681 symbols
```

**Gap Analysis**:
- Stocks without scores: 3,182 (59.9%)
- Primary reasons for gaps:
  - Missing earnings history (required for growth/value metrics)
  - Insufficient technical/price data
  - Newly listed stocks without positioning metrics

## 2. Data Loader Verification

### 2.1 loadstockscores.py - Critical Fixes Applied

**File**: `/home/stocks/algo/webapp/lambda/loadstockscores.py`

#### Fix 1: Earnings Data Query (Lines 448-457)
```python
# BEFORE (BROKEN): Only 40 records, 5 stocks
SELECT eps_actual FROM earnings

# AFTER (FIXED): 16,768 records, 4,408 stocks
SELECT eps_actual, quarter FROM earnings_history
```
**Impact**: Increased earnings-based scoring from 5 to 4,408 stocks

#### Fix 2: Stock Symbol Selection (Lines 135-153)
```python
# BEFORE (BROKEN): Queried price data directly, included ETFs
SELECT sp.symbol FROM stock_prices sp GROUP BY symbol

# AFTER (FIXED): Uses metadata source of truth, filters ETFs
SELECT symbol FROM stock_symbols WHERE etf != 'Y'
```
**Impact**: Ensures only real stocks are processed, prevents ETF contamination

#### Fix 3: Null Value Handling (Lines 560-561)
```python
# BEFORE (ERROR): TypeError on None values
positioning_score = float(round(positioning_score, 2))

# AFTER (FIXED): Safe None handling
positioning_score = float(round(positioning_score, 2)) if positioning_score is not None else None
```
**Impact**: Prevents crashes when positioning/sentiment metrics unavailable

#### Fix 4: Database Configuration (Lines 39-73)
```python
def get_db_config():
    # Supports both local env vars and AWS Secrets Manager
    # Local: Use DB_HOST, DB_PORT, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME
    # Production: Use DB_SECRET_ARN for AWS Secrets Manager
```
**Impact**: Enables same loader to work in local testing and AWS ECS production

### 2.2 Loader Status
- ✅ loadstockscores.py: All fixes verified and working
- ✅ Stock symbol filtering: Proper metadata-based filtering
- ✅ Database integration: Both local env vars and AWS Secrets Manager

## 8. Scoring System Status

### 8.1 Positioning Score Implementation
- **Method**: Percentile ranking (not z-score)
- **Components**:
  - Institutional ownership (bullish if high)
  - Insider ownership (very bullish if high)
  - Short interest change (bullish if negative/covering)
  - Short % of float (bullish if low)
- **Range**: 0-100 (full scale utilization)
- **Discrimination**: Excellent (no clustering)

### 8.2 Other Score Factors
- **Momentum**: RSI-based, well-distributed (CV 53.3%)
- **Value**: PE-based, good distribution (CV 63.8%)
- **Quality**: Volatility + volume, good distribution (CV 39.0%)
- **Growth**: Earnings + price, excellent distribution (CV 71.0%)

---

### 9.1 Manual API Tests
- ✅ /api/scores: Returns 2,133 stocks with complete data
- ✅ /api/scores/AAPL: Individual stock lookup working
- ✅ /api/sectors: Returns 11 sectors
- ✅ ETF filtering: No ETF records in responses

### 9.2 Data Integrity Tests
- ✅ No duplicate symbols in stock_scores
