PHASE 8: ENTRY EXECUTION

For each qualified signal from Phase 5:

1. Check halt flag before any entry
2. Check exposure constraints from Phase 3b
3. Run liquidity checks (ADV, dollar volume, price history age)
4. Compute true ATR (max of H-L, |H-prev_C|, |L-prev_C|) anchored to run_date
5. Compute SMA_50 anchored to run_date
6. Stop loss: min(SMA_50 - ATR, entry - 2*ATR) â€” lower stop = more room for the trade
7. Use PositionSizer for regime-aware, drawdown-adjusted sizing
8. Run PreTradeChecks (size cap, duplicate prevention, minimum order)
9. Execute trade

TIMEZONE REQUIREMENT: run_date parameter is always ET (Eastern Time), not UTC.
Market trading hours are 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET. Do NOT convert run_date to UTC or query
CURRENT_DATE/CURRENT_TIMESTAMP directly for trading decisions. All database queries should
use the run_date parameter or query price_daily MAX(date) to align with ET-based trading.
