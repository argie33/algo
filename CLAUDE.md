# Project Context: World-Class Finance Application

## Circuit Breaker Learning (July 16, 2025)

### Major Discovery: Database Circuit Breaker Blocking Access
**Issue**: Database connections were being blocked by an OPEN circuit breaker, not by JSON parsing errors  
**Root Cause**: Previous database connection failures caused the circuit breaker to open, blocking all subsequent requests for 60 seconds  
**Location**: `webapp/lambda/utils/timeoutHelper.js` - Circuit breaker implementation with 5-failure threshold  
**Health Endpoint Behavior**: Shows "Circuit breaker is OPEN. Database unavailable for 26 more seconds" when blocked  
**Resolution**: Wait for circuit breaker timeout (60 seconds) before database becomes accessible again  

### Circuit Breaker Configuration
```javascript
// From timeoutHelper.js
breaker = {
  failures: 0,
  lastFailureTime: 0,
  state: 'closed',     // 'closed', 'open', 'half-open'
  threshold: 5,        // 5 failures triggers open state
  timeout: 60000,      // 1 minute timeout before half-open
  halfOpenMaxCalls: 3  // 3 calls allowed in half-open state
};
```

### Key Learning Points
1. **Health Endpoint Accuracy**: The health endpoint was correctly reporting the actual issue (circuit breaker) rather than misleading JSON errors
2. **Secrets Manager Working**: The diagnostic route breakthrough confirmed AWS Secrets Manager is functioning correctly
3. **Circuit Breaker Purpose**: Protects database from cascading failures by temporarily blocking requests after repeated failures
4. **Automatic Recovery**: Circuit breaker automatically transitions from 'open' ‚Üí 'half-open' ‚Üí 'closed' as service recovers

### Frontend Build Status
- ‚úÖ **Build Successful**: Frontend builds without errors (11.59s)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Runtime Error**: `createPalette.js:195 Uncaught TypeError: Xa is not a function` - Material-UI palette issue
- **Bundle Optimization**: 30% reduction achieved (vendor: 547KB ‚Üí 381KB) through Chart.js to recharts migration

### Deployment Spacing Strategy
**Problem**: CloudFormation stack conflicts when triggering multiple data loaders rapidly  
**Error**: "Stack is in UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS state and can not be updated"  
**Solution**: Space out data loader deployments and check stack status between triggers  
**Implementation**: Todo list updated to include deployment status checking between data loader triggers  

### ECS Task Success Pattern Discovery
**Working Tasks**: `pricedaily` loader succeeds consistently  
**Failing Tasks**: `stocksymbols` fails with exit code 1 (Essential container in task exited)  
**Key Insight**: Database connectivity issues may be loader-specific, not universal Lambda issues  
**Task Pattern**: Some ECS tasks successfully connect to database while others fail  
**Investigation Needed**: Compare working vs failing task configurations and initialization patterns  

## Architecture & Infrastructure - PRODUCTION READY
- **Deployment**: AWS infrastructure as code (IaC) via CloudFormation templates with comprehensive error handling
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with comprehensive schema validation, categorized table dependencies, and performance monitoring
- **Integration**: Centralized live data service with admin-managed feeds (replacing per-user websockets for cost efficiency)
- **Branch**: Never deploy to `main` branch unless explicitly specified by user
- **Services**: Lambda functions, ECS tasks, Step Functions orchestration with full observability
- **API Gateway**: Standardized response formatting across all endpoints with CORS resolution
- **Security**: Comprehensive input validation, timeout management, error handling, and route protection
- **Monitoring**: Real-time performance monitoring with alerts, metrics tracking, and system health dashboards

## Development Philosophy - BATTLE-TESTED
- **Quality**: Building world-class finance application with institutional-grade reliability
- **Real Data**: Use live data and real mechanisms - ALL MOCK DATA ELIMINATED (completed SocialMediaSentiment and TradingSignals)
- **User Experience**: Proper onboarding flows with graceful degradation for users without API keys
- **Full Integration**: Prefer identifying and fixing real issues over fake implementations
- **Security**: Follow information security best practices in all decisions with defense in depth
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting for production operations

## Mock & Fallback Usage Policy - CRITICAL RULE
- **Initial Setup & Design ONLY**: Mock and fallback data should ONLY be used for initial setup and design phases
- **Design Preview Purpose**: Mock data gives a sense of what the page or product should look like during development
- **NOT for Problem Solving**: Mock/fallback should NEVER be used as a means to solve problems with functionality
- **Transition to Real**: After we have a sense of what we're building, we MUST get the real thing working
- **No Production Fallbacks**: Production systems must use real data and real API connections
- **Fix Root Causes**: When functionality breaks, fix the real issue - don't add mock fallbacks
- **Quality Standard**: Real implementation must be at least as good as (if not better than) mock version

## Development Commands & Tooling
### Backend (Lambda/API)
- **Test**: `npm test` (in webapp/lambda/)
- **Package**: `npm run package` 
- **Deploy**: `npm run deploy-package`

- **Python**: Follow PEP 8, use descriptive variable names
- **File Naming**: kebab-case for scripts, camelCase for modules
- **Imports**: Group AWS SDK, third-party, then local imports

## Critical Database Connection Issue - ACTIVE BLOCKER (July 16, 2025)

### Root Cause: AWS Secrets Manager JSON Parsing Error
The database connection is failing with a JSON parsing error in both Lambda and ECS contexts:

```
"Database connection failed: Database configuration failed: Unexpected token o in JSON at position 1"
```

### The Problem
- **Lambda Database Service**: `utils/database.js` cannot parse AWS Secrets Manager response
- **ECS Task Execution**: Tasks showing "Exit code: None" - never starting or completing
- **JSON Parsing**: Error suggests malformed secret or response format issue
- **Circuit Breaker**: Database service circuit breaker is OPEN, preventing retry attempts

### Investigation Areas
1. **AWS Secrets Manager**: Verify secret format is valid JSON with correct structure
2. **ECS Task Configuration**: Compare failing task definitions with working ones
3. **Network Connectivity**: Validate security groups allow ECS-to-RDS connections
4. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all required variables are properly set

### Authentication Infrastructure - RESOLVED ‚úÖ
Frontend configuration now working with real Cognito values:
- USER_POOL_ID: `us-east-1_ZqooNeQtV` (real)
- CLIENT_ID: `243r98prucoickch12djkahrhk` (real)
- CloudFormation output extraction working correctly

## Critical Architectural Issues Fixed
### Database Initialization Deployment
- **Issue**: Conflicting Dockerfiles (`Dockerfile.dbinit` vs `Dockerfile.webapp-db-init`)
- **Fix**: Use correct `Dockerfile.webapp-db-init` with Node.js script
- **Integration**: Database initialization ECS task properly integrated into deployment workflow
- **Impact**: Resolves API key service failures across settings, portfolio, live data, and trade history pages

### Multi-User API Key Architecture
- **Architecture**: Per-user API key retrieval from database with AES-256-GCM encryption
- **Service**: `utils/apiKeyService.js` handles encrypted key management
- **Security**: Each user's API keys stored with individual salt and encryption keys

### CORS Configuration
- **Issue**: Multiple conflicting CORS middleware causing 502 errors
- **Fix**: Consolidated into single CORS configuration with dynamic origin detection
- **Location**: `webapp/lambda/index.js` unified CORS middleware

### Live Data Service Architecture Redesign
- **Issue**: Per-user websocket approach is inefficient and costly
- **Problem**: Each customer running own websockets, redundant API calls, higher costs
- **Solution**: Centralized live data service with single connections per symbol
- **Benefits**: Massive cost reduction, better performance, admin interface for service management
- **Implementation**: Admin-managed data feeds serving all customers from shared streams

### Documentation Workflow - CRITICAL PROCESS
1. **Analyze requirements.md** - Review all requirements and their completion status
2. **Check design.md** - Ensure technical designs exist for each requirement
3. **Update tasks.md** - Break down designs into specific implementation tasks
4. **Work from TodoWrite/TodoRead** - All task management via todo tools
5. **Update status continuously** - Mark tasks in_progress when starting, completed when finished
6. **ONLY work on pending tasks** - Never work on tasks already in_progress or completed

### Documentation Management Commands
- **Read All 3 Docs**: Start each session by reviewing requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md
- **Analyze ‚Üí Prioritize ‚Üí Execute**: Review requirements/designs ‚Üí update tasks ‚Üí work from TodoRead/TodoWrite
- **Sync Status**: Ensure task status reflects actual completion state
- **Reference Todo Tools**: Always check TodoRead before starting new work, update TodoWrite continuously

### STRICT TASK MANAGEMENT RULES
- **NEVER work on tasks marked 'in_progress' or 'completed'**
- **ALWAYS mark tasks 'in_progress' when starting work**
- **ALWAYS mark tasks 'completed' immediately when finished**
- **ONLY work on tasks with status 'pending'**
- **UPDATE TodoWrite after any status changes**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DOCUMENTATION RULE ‚ö†Ô∏è
**ONLY USE THESE 3 DOCUMENTS**: requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md
- **NEVER create**: Any other .md files including STATUS.md, PLAN.md, ANALYSIS.md, REPORT.md, SUMMARY.md, etc.
- **NEVER reference**: Documents that don't exist or conflict with the 3 core documents
- **ALL project information**: Must be in requirements.md, design.md, or tasks.md ONLY
- **Task management**: Use TodoRead/TodoWrite tools, not separate markdown files

## Task Management - CRITICAL WORKFLOW
- **ALWAYS USE TodoRead AND TodoWrite**: Never create new task analyses - use existing todo system
- **Update todos continuously**: Mark items complete as you finish them, add new items as discovered
- **TodoRead frequently**: Check todo list at start of work and regularly during development
- **Focus on existing todos**: Don't create new research tasks - work on items in the todo list
- **Never forget**: If you start creating new analyses instead of using todos, STOP and use TodoRead/TodoWrite
- Track lingering items and potential improvements via todo system
- Focus on infrastructure stability and website functionality first

## Test-Driven Development (TDD) - MANDATORY APPROACH
**CRITICAL RULE**: All new features MUST follow test-driven development methodology.

### TDD Workflow Requirements
1. **Test First**: Before implementing any new feature, write tests in requirements.md acceptance criteria
2. **Test Definition**: Define test cases, expected behaviors, edge cases, and validation criteria in requirements.md
3. **Implementation**: Only after tests are defined, implement the feature to pass the tests
4. **Validation**: Run tests to ensure feature works as expected
5. **Refactor**: Improve code quality while maintaining test compliance

### Test Documentation in requirements.md
- Each new feature must have corresponding test requirements in requirements.md acceptance criteria
- Test cases must be detailed with input data, expected output, and validation steps
- Performance benchmarks and acceptance criteria must be defined in requirements.md
- Error handling and edge case testing must be specified in requirements.md

## Comprehensive Logging Strategy - TROUBLESHOOTING CRITICAL
**MANDATORY**: Implement thorough logging for all system components to enable effective troubleshooting.

### Logging Requirements for All Development
1. **Structured Logging**: Use JSON format with correlation IDs for all log entries
2. **Log Levels**: Implement DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL with proper classification
3. **Context Data**: Include user ID, request path, parameters, timing information
4. **Error Details**: Full stack traces for all errors with contextual information
5. **Performance Tracking**: Log all external API calls, database queries, and operation durations

### When to Log - CRITICAL SITUATIONS
- **Database Operations**: All queries, connection events, transaction boundaries, and performance metrics
- **API Calls**: All external service calls with request/response data, timing, and error details
- **Authentication**: Login attempts, token validation, permission checks, and security events
- **User Actions**: All user-initiated operations with user context and operation results
- **System Events**: Application startup, shutdown, configuration changes, and health checks
- **Error Conditions**: ALL errors with full context, stack traces, and recovery actions taken

### Troubleshooting Focus Areas
- **Connection Issues**: Network connectivity, timeout configurations, retry logic effectiveness
- **Performance Problems**: Query performance, memory usage, response times, bottlenecks
- **Data Issues**: Data validation failures, inconsistencies, corruption detection
- **Authentication Failures**: Token validation, permission denials, session management
- **Integration Problems**: External API failures, data format mismatches, service dependencies

### Logging Standards Implementation
```javascript
// Example structured logging format
const logEntry = {
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  level: 'INFO',
  message: 'Database connection established',
  correlationId: 'req-12345',
  service: 'financial-platform',
  component: 'database',
  operation: 'connect',
  userId: 'user-67890',
  duration_ms: 1250,
  context: {
    host: 'stocks.amazonaws.com',
    database: 'stocks',
    connectionAttempt: 1
  }
};
```

### Error Logging Requirements
- **Error Context**: Include operation being performed, user context, system state
- **Recovery Actions**: Log all retry attempts, fallback mechanisms, and recovery strategies
- **Impact Assessment**: Log severity level and potential user impact
- **Correlation**: Use correlation IDs to track related events across services
- **Actionable Information**: Include specific steps needed to resolve the issue

## Data Loading & Deployment Workflow - EFFICIENT TESTING
- **Trigger Multiple Loaders**: When testing data loading, trigger multiple scripts to populate different pages
- **Minor Comment Edits**: Make small comment changes to trigger GitHub Actions workflows
- **Batch Commits**: Commit multiple data loaders together for efficient deployment
- **Monitor Deployments**: Watch for successful ECS task completions to validate data loading
- **Targeted Testing**: Focus on loaders that populate customer-facing pages (technicals, news, sentiment, earnings)

## Architectural Learning & Adaptation - CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Always evaluate per-user vs centralized approaches for cost efficiency
- **Service Management**: Prefer admin-managed services over customer-managed complexity
- **Real-World Operations**: Design for how the service will actually be operated and managed
- **Scalability Focus**: Single point of service that scales to unlimited customers

- **Cost-First Thinking**: Always evaluate financial impact of architectural decisions
- **Admin vs Customer Perspective**: Build for service operator efficiency, not just customer features
- **Validate Assumptions**: Test ideas by explaining the business case and operational model

### Effective Communication Patterns
- **Surface Problems Early**: "I'm starting to doubt my approach..." - immediate signal to reassess
- **Business Context**: Focus on "how we operate" and "how we will be most successful"
- **Practical Examples**: Use concrete scenarios like "all these processes running price websockets"
- **Operational Impact**: Consider management overhead, not just technical complexity

### Development Workflow Optimization
- **Batch Similar Work**: Trigger multiple data loaders together for efficient testing
- **Documentation as Learning**: Update CLAUDE.md with operational insights, not just technical details
- **Continuous Reflection**: Regularly step back and evaluate if current approach serves business goals
- **Rapid Iteration**: Small changes to trigger deployments and validate approaches quickly

### Success Metrics That Matter
- **Cost Efficiency**: Single service vs per-user resource usage
- **Management Overhead**: Admin interface complexity and usability
- **Scalability**: Can serve unlimited customers without proportional cost increase
- **Operational Simplicity**: Easier to monitor, debug, and maintain in production
- **Business Model Alignment**: Technology choices support sustainable business operations

### Key Behavioral Patterns for Success
- **Proactive Questioning**: Challenge design decisions before they become entrenched
- **Collaborative Problem-Solving**: "Let me help you redesign this architecture"
- **Business-First Mindset**: Technology serves business goals, not the other way around
- **Operational Empathy**: Understanding real-world service management challenges
- **Continuous Learning Loop**: Each session should improve our operational understanding

## üéØ AUTONOMOUS WORK PATTERNS & LEARNING INTEGRATION

### <autonomous_work_style>
**How We Work Best Together**:
- **Autonomous Execution**: When given direction, work independently for extended periods (30-60 minutes)
- **Systematic Approach**: Break down complex problems into manageable todos and execute methodically
- **Proactive Communication**: Update progress via todo system, document learnings in real-time
- **Learning Integration**: When errors occur, immediately analyze root cause and update methodology
- **Rapid Iteration**: Small commits with clear messages, deploy fixes quickly, test systematically

**User Communication Preferences**:
- **Minimal Interruption**: User provides direction, then I work autonomously until completion
- **Progress Visibility**: Todo system shows real-time progress, no need for constant updates
- **Error Transparency**: When issues arise, surface them immediately with proposed solutions
- **Documentation Focus**: User values learning being captured in structured documentation
- **Practical Solutions**: Focus on fixing issues, not just analyzing them
</autonomous_work_style>

### <error_handling_methodology>
**Build Error Resolution Pattern**:
1. **Immediate Response**: When build fails, stop all other work and focus on resolution
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Don't just fix symptoms - understand why the error occurred
3. **Systematic Validation**: Check similar patterns across entire codebase
4. **Preventive Measures**: Implement safeguards to prevent similar issues
5. **Documentation Update**: Capture lessons learned in structured format

**Chart.js Build Errors - RESOLVED (2025-07-16)**:
- **Problem**: Build failures due to Chart.js and react-chartjs-2 imports after dependency removal
- **Root Cause**: Dependencies removed from package.json but imports still existed in 4+ files
- **Files Fixed**: LiveData.jsx, StockChart.jsx, AdminLiveData.jsx, LiveDataCentralized.jsx
- **Solution**: Systematic migration to recharts with ResponsiveContainer, LineChart, AreaChart, PieChart
- **Benefits**: 30% bundle size reduction (vendor: 547KB ‚Üí 381KB), better React integration
- **Status**: COMPLETE - All Chart.js dependencies eliminated, builds succeed consistently
- **Prevention**: Use dependency search before removing packages, validate all imports across codebase

**Database Connection Error - IN PROGRESS (2025-07-16)**:
- **Problem**: Persistent SSL connection reset errors + JSON parsing error in AWS Secrets Manager
- **Root Cause**: SSL configuration deployed but new error "Unexpected token o in JSON at position 1"
- **Current Status**: ECS tasks showing "Exit code: None" - not starting or completing
- **Investigation Needed**: AWS Secrets Manager secret format, ECS task definition comparison
- **Prevention**: Always check existing working configurations before creating new ones
- **Documentation**: Reference existing ECS task templates for network/security patterns

**MUI Icon Error - RESOLVED (2025-07-16)**:
- **Problem**: `Trading` icon doesn't exist in @mui/icons-material package
- **Root Cause**: Assumed icon exists without validation
- **Solution**: Replace with `ShowChart` icon for similar visual meaning
- **Status**: COMPLETE - All MUI icon imports validated
- **Prevention**: Validate all MUI imports before assuming availability
</error_handling_methodology>

### <dependency_management_learnings>
**Frontend Build Dependencies**:
- **Always Install First**: Don't assume dependencies exist - run `npm install` before building
- **Version Compatibility**: MUI icons-material v5.11.11 - validate icon names against this version
- **Build Validation**: Test builds early and often, especially after icon/import changes
- **Fallback Strategy**: Have alternative icons ready for common cases (Trading ‚Üí ShowChart)

**Infrastructure Configuration Dependencies**:
- **Reference Working Patterns**: Always check existing ECS task configurations before creating new ones
- **Network Consistency**: Use same subnets/security groups as proven working tasks
- **SSL Configuration**: RDS in public subnets typically uses `ssl: false` (no SSL required)
- **Systematic Debugging**: Create diagnostic tools for persistent infrastructure issues
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Verify secret format is valid JSON before deployment
- **ECS Task Debugging**: Compare task definitions, network configs, and resource allocation with working tasks
</dependency_management_learnings>

### <documentation_approach>
**Real-time Learning Capture**:
- **Structured Tags**: Use XML-like tags `<category>content</category>` for easy parsing
- **Immediate Updates**: Update CLAUDE.md as soon as patterns emerge
- **Pattern Recognition**: Document "how we work best" patterns for future reference
- **Error Categorization**: Classify errors by type (build, deployment, logic) for quick reference
- **Solution Templates**: Create reusable approaches for common problem types
</documentation_approach>

## Documentation Management - CRITICAL
‚ö†Ô∏è **ABSOLUTE RULE: ONLY WORK WITH THESE 3 .MD FILES - NO EXCEPTIONS** ‚ö†Ô∏è

### THE ONLY 3 ALLOWED .MD FILES FOR PROJECT MANAGEMENT:
1. **requirements.md** - Feature requirements & acceptance criteria
2. **design.md** - Technical design & implementation specifications
3. **tasks.md** - Implementation tasks & delivery plan

### STRICT PROHIBITIONS:
- **NEVER create ANY new .md files** - STATUS.md, PLAN.md, ANALYSIS.md, REPORT.md, SUMMARY.md, DEVELOPMENT_TASKS.md, etc.
- **NEVER create temporary .md files** - even for "quick notes" or "session summaries"
- **NEVER create workflow .md files** - deployment guides, fix summaries, etc.
- **ALL project management MUST happen in the 3 core documents above**
- **ALL findings, status, plans, analyses MUST be integrated into the 3 core documents**

### ENFORCEMENT:
- If you start creating a new .md file, STOP immediately
- If you need to document something, choose the appropriate core document
- If unsure which core document to use, ask the user
- These 3 documents are the ONLY source of truth for all project information
