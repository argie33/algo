## ⏳ What's Blocking Deployment

**Current Blocker**: AWS IAM Permissions

**User's Current Status**: `arn:aws:iam::626216981288:user/reader` (read-only)

**Required Permissions**:
- RDS: Full access (create/modify/delete instances)
- S3: Full access (create buckets, manage objects)
- EC2: Full access (create/modify/delete instances)
- CloudFront: Full access (create distributions)
- Lambda: Full access (create/deploy functions)
- IAM: Limited access (create/assume roles)
- API Gateway: Full access

**How to Fix**: Contact AWS account administrator with permission request template (provided in documentation)

**Expected Timeline**: 1-2 hours for approval

## 📋 Deployment Steps (Once Permissions Approved)

### Step 1: Run Automated Script (15 min)
```bash
bash /home/stocks/algo/deploy-to-aws.sh
```
Creates RDS, S3 buckets, uploads database, deploys frontend

### Step 2: Restore Database (30-60 min)
```bash
psql -h $RDS_ENDPOINT -U postgres -d stocks < /tmp/stocks_database.sql
```

### Step 3: Deploy Backend (5 min)
```bash
cd /home/stocks/algo/webapp/lambda
export DB_HOST=$RDS_ENDPOINT
serverless deploy --region us-east-1
```

### Step 4: Update & Redeploy Frontend (5 min)
```bash
cd /home/stocks/algo/webapp/frontend
cat > .env.production << EOF
VITE_API_URL=https://[API_ENDPOINT]/api
EOF
npm run build
aws s3 sync dist/ s3://[BUCKET]/ --delete
```

### Step 5: Test & Verify (10 min)
- Test API endpoints
- Verify all industries load
- Check performance metrics
- Confirm charts render

## 🎉 Summary

**Everything is ready for AWS deployment!**

The only remaining blocker is AWS IAM permission elevation, which requires user action to request from their AWS account administrator. Once permissions are approved, deployment can proceed with straightforward automated and manual steps.

### Timeline to Production
- **Permission Request**: Today
- **Permission Approval**: 1-2 hours (typical)
- **Actual Deployment**: 2-3 hours (mostly waiting)
- **Testing & Verification**: 30 minutes
- **Total**: ~4-6 hours from permission approval to live

### What the User Should Do Next
1. Review `DEPLOYMENT_ACTION_PLAN.md`
2. Contact AWS administrator with permission request
3. Wait for approval
4. Run `bash deploy-to-aws.sh`
5. Follow the remaining manual steps
6. Verify everything works

**Status**: ✅ READY - All preparation complete, awaiting permission approval
