# Economic Indicators Dashboard - Complete Implementation

## Overview
You now have a comprehensive **production-ready economic indicators dashboard** with real recession probability modeling, credit spreads analysis, yield curve visualization, and economic calendar integration - all using **real FRED data** (no mock/synthetic data).

## Architecture

### Data Layer (Real FRED Data)
**Source**: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED API)
**Database**: PostgreSQL `economic_data` and `economic_calendar` tables

**Data Loader**: `loadecondata.py` (Python ECS Lambda task)
- Loads 70+ FRED economic series automatically
- Populates economic calendar events from FRED releases
- Runs on schedule via ECS deployment

### Backend APIs (All Real Calculations from DB)

#### 1. **Recession Forecast Endpoint** (`/api/market/recession-forecast`)
- **Multi-factor recession probability model** (not hardcoded)
- Based on real inputs:
  - Yield curve spreads (2y10y, 3m10y)
  - Credit spreads (HY OAS, IG OAS)
  - Unemployment rate trends
  - Federal Funds rate
  - Market volatility (VIX)
  - Initial jobless claims

**Model Weights**:
- Yield Curve: 35% (strongest predictor)
- Credit Spreads: 25% 
- Labor Market: 20%
- Monetary Policy: 15%
- Market Volatility: 5%

**Output**:
- Recession probability (0-100%)
- Economic stress index (0-100)
- 4 ensemble forecast models with confidence levels
- Detailed factor analysis with visual indicators (ðŸ”´ðŸŸ ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¢)
- Actionable next steps

#### 2. **Credit Spreads Analysis** (`/api/market/credit-spreads`)
- **Credit stress index** (real HY/IG spread data)
- High Yield spreads by rating (BB, B)
- Investment Grade spreads by rating (AAA, BBB)
- BAA-AAA corporate bond spreads
- Financial Conditions Index
- Risk recommendations based on actual spreads

#### 3. **Leading Economic Indicators** (`/api/market/leading-indicators`)
- 10+ key economic indicators
- Full yield curve data (3M to 30Y maturities) for charting
- **Real economic calendar events** from database (10 upcoming)
- Economic stress index calculation

#### 4. **Economic Scenarios** (`/api/market/economic-scenarios`)
- Dynamic scenarios based on current economic conditions
- Bull, Base, Bear cases
- Probabilities weighted to sum to 100%

### Frontend Components (React + MUI)

**Location**: `/home/stocks/algo/webapp/frontend/src/pages/EconomicModeling.jsx`

**5-Tab Dashboard**:

#### Tab 0: Recession Model (NEW)
- Advanced recession probability display
- Stress index visualization
- 4 ensemble model probabilities
- Key indicator summaries
- Model factor breakdown with color coding

#### Tab 1: Leading Indicators
- 10 key economic indicators
- Signal strength progress bars
- Positive/Negative/Neutral classifications
- Real upcoming economic events calendar

#### Tab 2: Yield Curve (FIXED)
- Full yield curve chart (3M to 30Y)
- 2y10y and 3m10y spreads
- Inversion analysis with historical accuracy
- Average lead time to recession

#### Tab 3: Credit Spreads (NEW)
- Credit stress index
- Financial conditions index
- HY/IG spreads by rating
- Color-coded signals
- Spread context and interpretation

#### Tab 4: Scenarios
- Bull/Base/Bear cases
- Probabilities and weighted outcomes
- GDP growth, unemployment, Fed rate forecasts

**Housing**: Housing Starts, Building Permits, Home Prices, Vacancies

### Economic Calendar Database

**Source**: FRED releases + scheduled events
**Table**: `economic_calendar`
**Data**: Event name, date/time, importance, category, forecast/previous values
**Integration**: Automatically displayed in Leading Indicators tab
**Refresh**: Updated by loadecondata.py with each run

## How to Run & Test

### 1. Load Economic Data
```bash
cd /home/stocks/algo
python loadecondata.py
```
This loads all 70+ FRED series + calendar events into PostgreSQL.

### 2. Start Backend
```bash
# ECS deployment or local Lambda
npm start  # in webapp/lambda directory
```

### 3. Access Dashboard
```
http://localhost:3000/economic-modeling
```

### 4. Check Real Data Loaded
Browser console shows:
- Number of leading indicators loaded
- Economic calendar events found
- Series availability status
