|--------|---------------|-------|
| Total Stocks | How many stocks in analysis | Baseline |
| Advancing | Stocks up | Combined with declining for ratio |
| Declining | Stocks down | Combined with advancing for ratio |
| Advance/Decline Ratio | Ups vs Downs | <1=bullish, >1=bearish |
| Breadth Percentile | Market rank 0-100% | Shows if extremes reached |

### Moving Averages

|----|-----------|----------|
| 20-day | 1 month | Short-term momentum confirmation |

| 200-day | ~1 year | Long-term trend confirmation |

**% Above MA Interpretation**:
- 80%+ = Strong trend in direction
- 50-80% = Moderate trend
- <50% = Trend breaking or opposite direction

### Market Extremes
- **Percentile Rank**: Where market breadth sits in 90-day distribution
- **Standard Deviations**: How far market is from average
  - >+2σ = Extremely overbought
  - +1σ to +2σ = Extended upside
  - ±1σ = Normal range
  - -1σ to -2σ = Extended downside
  - <-2σ = Extremely oversold

### Positioning & Sentiment
- **AAII**: Retail investor sentiment (weekly)
- **NAAIM**: Professional investor sentiment (weekly)
- **Fear & Greed**: 0-100 index
  - 0-25 = Extreme fear (buying opportunity)

## 📊 How Market Internals Help Trading

### Identifying Overbought Markets
```
IF breadth_rank > 80%
   AND % stocks above 200-day MA > 75%
   AND Std Dev > +1.5σ
THEN market is overbought → consider taking profits
```

### Identifying Oversold Markets
```
IF breadth_rank < 20%
   AND % stocks above 200-day MA < 30%
   AND Fear & Greed Index < 25
THEN market is oversold → potential bottom forming
```

### Confirming Trends
```
For Uptrends:
- % above 200-day MA should be > 70%
- A/D ratio should be < 1.0
- Breadth rank > 50%

For Downtrends:
- % above 200-day MA should be < 40%
- A/D ratio should be > 1.0
- Breadth rank < 50%
```

### Spotting Reversals
```
When market hits extremes:
- Breadth > 90% OR < 10%
- Standard deviation > ±2.0σ
- Fear & Greed at 0, 25, 75, or 100

Watch for reversal signals in these conditions

## 🎓 Key Insights

### What High Breadth Means
- More stocks participating in move
- Trend is broad-based and healthy
- Less likely to reverse suddenly
- But if extreme (>90%), market extended

### What Low Breadth Means
- Few stocks driving market
- Trend is concentrated/fragile
- Could reverse quickly
- But if extreme (<10%), potential bottom

### What % Above 200MA Means
- Shows macro trend health
- 200-day = ~1 year of data
- Gold standard for trend confirmation
- Most reliable MA for long-term view

### What StdDev Tells You
- Statistical measure of extremes
- ±1σ = normal 68% of time
- >2σ = rare event, mean reversion likely
- <-2σ = extreme oversold, buying opportunity
